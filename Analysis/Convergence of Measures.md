Here are three ways in which measures $\mu_n$ can converge.

- ==**Total Variation**==: We converge under the TV distance $\norm{\mu - \nu}_{TV} = \sup_f: \{\int_X fd\mu - \int_X fd\nu\}$ where the supremum is over all measurable functions from $X\to [-1,1]$. 
- ==**Set-wise**==: $\mu_n(A)\to \mu(A)$ for every $A\in \FFF$. This is also called "strong convergence" sometimes, but "set-wise" is completely unambiguous.
- ==**Weak convergence**==: See [[Weak Convergence]].
