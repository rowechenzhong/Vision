A [[Continuous Random Process Definitions|random process]] such that every finite collection exhibits a [[Gaussian Random Variable|multivariate normal distribution]].

If $X$ is a centered Gaussian process, then the closed linear subspace of $L^2$ spanned by the variables $(X_t)_{t\in T}$ is a [[Gaussian spaces|Gaussian space]], which is called the ==**Gaussian space generated by $X$**==.
