Let $A\subset \RR^p$ be a closed subset of a Euclidean space. Given some "$C^m$" function $f:A\to \RR$, I might ask if it is possible to extend $f$ to a $C^m$ function on $\RR^p$. The answer is yes, with the following modifications:
- $A$ does not generically have a differentiable structure (it has edges!). So instead, we give a collection of functions $f_\alpha$ for all multi-indices such that $\abs{\alpha}\leq m$, which satisfy the obvious compatibility conditions.
- The extension $F$ can be taken to be real analytic on $\RR^n\setminus A$!

It is pretty tedious to write down what the compatibility conditions are. Suffice to say, if you give me a bona fide $C^m$ function $f$ on some open $U\subset \RR^p$ and then pick a closed $A\subset U$, $f\big\vert_U$ will satisfy these conditions.
