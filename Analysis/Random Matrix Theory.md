More stuff that I've heard before:

# Circle Law

Consider like uh a limit $\sum \frac!N \delta_{\lambda_i}$ approaching $\sqrt{4 - t^2}$.

$R^{(N)}_m$ is the $m$-point correlation function; $\frac{1}{n\rho(u)}$ governs the scaling of the eigenvalues.

Then, properly renormalized, $\lim_{N\to \infty} $\frac{1}{(N\rho(u))^m} R^{(N)}_m = \det\left( \frac{\sin(t_i - t_j)}{\pi(t_i - t_j)}\right)$. 

# ? Some other theorem about spectral gaps?

As $t_N\to \infty$ with $t_N/N\to 0$, let $S_N(s,x) = \frac{1}{2t_n} \abs{\{j: x_{j+1} - x_j < \frac{s}{N\rho(u)},\qquad \abs{x_j - u} < \frac{t_N}{N\rho_u}\}}$. 

Then, there is a limit of expectations of $S_N(s,x)$.
