> [!theorem] Integration Works
> Let $f,g: \Omega \to \CC$ be measurable functions. If $f,g$ agree almost everywhere, then their integrability and integrals match. Then, given that they are both integrable:
>
> -   __Addition:__ $\int_\Omega f + g = \int_\Omega f + \int_\Omega g$.
>
> -   __Scaling:__ Let $c\in \CC$. Then $\int_\Omega cf = c\int_\Omega f$.
>
> -   __Inequalities:__ If $f\leq g$ almost everywhere, then $\int_\Omega f \leq \int_\Omega g$.
>
> Finally, and most importantly, if $f: [a,b]\to \RR$ is Riemann integrable, then it is Lebesgue integrable and the integrals match.
