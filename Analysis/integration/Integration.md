This is the [[homepage|home page]] for integration. All integration will be measure theoretic, and will focus on integration into the real numbers. I suppose integration can be done into other ranges, but the essence of integration requires an additive space where limits exist, and that sounds like $\CC^n$ to me.

# Main Sequence

First, one needs to set up the standard scaffolding necessary to understand measure spaces.
1. [[measurable functions]]
2. [[real-valued measurable functions]]

Next, there is the construction of our integral, along with its basic properties.
3. [[constructing the Lebesgue Integral]]
4. [[Arithmetic properties of Lebesgue Integral]]
5. [[Convergence properties of Lebesgue Integral]]
6. [[Fubini-Tonelli]]

Here are some things you learned in high school.
7. [[Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]]
8. [[Change of Variables of Real functions]]

Finally, here are some results pertinent to probability theory:
9. [[Change of Variables Formula]]
