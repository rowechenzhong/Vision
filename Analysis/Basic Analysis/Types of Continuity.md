In increasing order, for functions defined on $[0,1]$, there is the following chain in increasing strength.
- Continuous
- Uniformly Continuous
- $\alpha$-Holder continuous
- Lipschitz continuous
- Continuously differentiable

# $\alpha$-Holder Continuity
For some $C\geq 0$, $\alpha > 0$, $\forall x,y$  $\abs{f(x) - f(y)} \leq C\norm{x - y}^\alpha$. On *bounded* spaces, this condition becomes stronger as $\alpha$ increases.
1. $\alpha = 0$ is meaningless on a bounded space. $\alpha \in (0,1]$ is the generic range.
2. If $\alpha = 1$, we obtain *Lipschitz continuity*.
3. If $\alpha > 1$, the function is constant (exercise).

A function is ==**locally $\alpha$-Holder continuous**== if one can find this $C$ for any compact subset of the domain.
