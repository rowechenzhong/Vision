Suppose $B_t$ is a standard Brownian motion in $\RR^d$ with $d\geq 3$, starting at $B_0 = (1,0,\dots, 0)$. Consider the green's function $f(x) = \frac{1}{\norm{x}^{d-2}}$ which is harmonic on $x\neq 0$, and let $M = f(X)$. Then, because $\braket{B^i, B^j} = 0$,$$\pa_i f = \frac{(2-d)x_i}{\norm{x}^d}$$Thus$$dM_t = (2-d)\sum_i \frac{B_t^i}{\norm{B_t}^d}dB_t^i$$and $M_t$ is a local martingale.
