Suppose we're also given a filtration $(\FFF_t)_{t\geq 0}$ on $(\Omega, \FFF, \PP)$. Then, of course Brownian motions can be adapted to the filtration. We make the stronger claim that $X_{s+t} - X_s$ is independent of $\FFF_s$; basically, you can make $\FFF_t$ finer than $\FFF_t^X$, but you'd better not reveal any information about the future.

Any Brownian motion is trivially $(\FFF_t^X)_{t\geq 0}$-adapted.
