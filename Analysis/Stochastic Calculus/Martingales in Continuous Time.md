An *adapted* ($\FFF_t$-measurable at time $t$) *integrable* (such that the expectations exist) random process $X$ is said to be a ==**martingale**== if for all $0\leq s \leq t$,
$$\EE[X_t | \FFF_s] = [X_s]$$
Ditto for ==**continuous/cadlag martingales**==, corresponding ==**sub/super-martingales**==, etc.
