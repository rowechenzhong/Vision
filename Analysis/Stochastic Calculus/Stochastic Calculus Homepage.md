This is the [[homepage]] for Stochastic Calculus. Our objective is to define the Stochastic Integral and show how to use it.

This can be learned independently from [[Markov Processes Homepage|markov processes]].

# Main Sequence
### Prerequisites
1. [[Probability]]
2. In particular, [[Random Processes in Continuous Time]].
3. See also [[A Gaussian Universe]].
4. We never really talked about this in elementary probability: [[Transition Kernels]]

### Continuous Semi-martingales

Continuous semi-martingales are the most general class of continuous-sample-path processes under which stochastic integration can be defined. In this section, we will define them.

I'm so hyped :D let's dive in. We will use [[Riemann Summation Shorthand]].

- [[Finite Variation Processes]]
- [[Continuous Local Martingales]]
- [[Quadratic Variation of Continuous Local Martingales]]
- [[Braket of Continuous Local Martingales]]
- Continuous Local Martingale + Finite Variation Process = [[Continuous Semimartingale]]

For more intuition on CLMs, see [[Infinitesimal Shorthand]].

### Stochastic Integration

- [[Construction of Stochastic Integral]]
- [[Convergence Properties of the Stochastic Integral]]
- [[Discretization Property of the Stochastic Integral]]
- The celebrated [[Ito Formula]]

### Applications
Let's play some games!
- [[Exponential CLM]]
- [[Product Rule]]
- [[Braket Chain Rule]]
- [[Harmonic Function of Brownian Motion in nD]]
- [[Levy's Characterization of Brownian Motion]]
- [[Continuous Martingales are Time-Changed Brownian Motion]]
- [[Brownian Motion is Conformally Invariant]]
- [[The BDG Inequalities]]
- [[Martingales are Stochastic Integrals]]

A rather tricky but important game:
- [[Girsanov's Theorem]]
- [[Cameron-Martin Formula|Cameron-Martin]]
- [[Hitting times for BM with drift]]
