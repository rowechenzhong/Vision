A quick application of the [[Cameron-Martin Formula]] is to compute the law of $U_a = \inf\left\{t\geq 0: B_t + ct = a\right\}$. Recall that we already know the density of $T_a = \inf\left\{t\geq 0: B_t = a\right\}$ is
$$\frac{a}{\sqrt{2\pi t^3}} \exp\left(-\frac{a^2}{2t}\right) \id_{t > 0}.$$
We get that the density is
$$\frac{a}{\sqrt{2\pi t^3}} \exp\left(-\frac{(a-ct)^2}{2t}\right) \id_{t > 0}.$$which is pretty cute.
