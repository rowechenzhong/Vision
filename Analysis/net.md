A ==**directed set**== $(I, \leq)$ is a collection $I$ with a preorder $\leq$ (a reflex transitive binary relation) such that for all $a,b\in I$, there exists $c\in I$ such that $a\leq c$ and $b\leq c$.

A ==**net**== in $X$ is a map from a directed set $I$ to $X$; $I$ is considered as an "index set."
