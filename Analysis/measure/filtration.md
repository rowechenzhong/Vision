Suppose $(\Omega, \FFF, \PP)$ is a probability space. A ==**filtration**== of $\FFF$ is a sequence $(\FFF_n)_{n\geq 0}$ of $\sigma$-algebras
$$
	\FFF_0 \subseteq \FFF_1 \subseteq \dots \subseteq \FFF
$$

We set $\FFF_\infty = \sigma\left(\FFF_n : n\geq 0\right)$. Note that it is possible that $\FFF_\infty\subsetneq \FFF$, although if this is the case we usually don't care about $\FFF$.

> [!idea] Interpretation
> $n$ is naturally identified with causal time, and $\FFF_n$ represents the information of the universe.
