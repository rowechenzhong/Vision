> [!theorem] Semialgebra extension
> Let $S$ be a [[semi-algebra]] over $\Omega$, and let $\mu$ be a pre-measure on $S$. Let $\AAA_0$ be the algebra generated by $S$, given exactly by the set of finite disjoint unions of elements in $S$. Then, there exists a unique extension pre-measure $\mu: \AAA_0\to [0,\infty]$.

This behaves exactly the same as [[Lebesgue Measure#^9d140c]].
