The main idea is that these two definitions neatly partition the definition of a $\sigma$-algebra:

> [!theorem] $\pi + \lambda = \sigma$
>
> $\LL$ is a $\sigma$-algebra iff it is both a $\pi$-system and a $\lambda$-system.

> [!proof]
> First off, all $\sigma$-algebras are clearly $\pi$ systems, and satisfy the first two properties of $\lambda$-systems. The third property is simply a special case of countable unions.
>
> If you are a $\lambda$ system, then you have $\Omega$. Thus by the second condition you have complements. If you also a $\pi$ system, then finite intersections give you finite unions. Finally, given any collection $A_1, A_2,\cdots \in \LL$, their prefix unions $A_1\cup \cdots A_n$ are all in $\LL$, and thus by the third condition of $\lambda$-systems, their union is also in $\LL$.

> [!theorem] Dynkin's $\pi$-$\lambda$ Theorem
> Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a $\pi$-system, and $\LL$ be a $\lambda$-system. If $\mathcal{P} \subseteq \LL$, then $\sigma(\mathcal{P}) \subseteq \LL$.

> To prove the theorem, let $\LL$ be the smallest $\lambda$-system containing $\mathcal{P}$, which can be obtained as the intersection of all $\lambda$-systems containing $\mathcal{P}$ (via Zorn's Lemma for instance). We will show that $\LL$ is a $\pi$-system, as this would show it is a $\sigma$-field.

> Then, $\mathcal{P}\subset \LL''$ because $\LL = \LL'$. Thus $\LL'' = \LL$ as desired.

> [!idea]
> Measure-theoretic proofs are difficult because we donâ€™t have a closed form for all measurable subsets. Instead, we must first verify that a certain subset $\mathcal{P}$ has a property $\LL$ that we want. Then, Dynkin booststraps the results from $\mathcal{P}$ to its $\sigma$-algebra.
