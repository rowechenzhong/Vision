The [[Lebesgue Measure]], [[Stieltjes Measure]], and [[box product measure]] both follow the following general construction:
1. Begin with a [[semi-algebra]] equipped with a [[pre-measure]]
2. Use [[semialgebra extension]] to extend this to a [[pre-measure]] on an [[measurable space#^algebra|algebra]].
3. Use [[Caratheodory extension Theorem]] to upgrade to a measure on a $\sigma$-algebra.
