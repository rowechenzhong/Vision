>[!idea] Fundamental idea of Measure Theory
>Measure theory cannot detect measure $0$ sets. No integral and no convergence theorem will ever require or provide a statement about a measure $0$ set.

Let $\sim$ be the equivalence relation on measurable functions $\FFF\to \GGG$ called agreement almost everywhere. We forever denote $[f]$ as the equivalence class of $f$, and write $[f] = [g]$ instead of writing "$f = g$ almost everywhere."

>I have written most of these notes without using this convention, but it is morally correct I believe. $\LL^p$ is strictly superior to $L^p$, etc.

To fix conventions on how this interacts with other common notation:
- We write $[f] \geq [g]$ if there exist elements $f\in [f]$ and $g\in [g]$ such that $f\geq g$.
