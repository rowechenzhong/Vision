The [[box product measure]] is inadequate whenever we have an infinite number of spaces $(\Omega_\alpha, \FFF_\alpha, \PP_\alpha)_{\alpha\in I}$ to combine. We desire to define
$$(\Omega, \FFF, \PP) = \left(\prod_{\alpha \in I} \Omega_\alpha, \bigotimes_{\alpha \in I} \FFF_\alpha, \bigotimes_{\alpha \in I} \PP_\alpha\right).$$

>[!example] Percolation model
>For every point $(x,y)\in \ZZ^2$, we flip a coin. The percolation problem discusses large-scale structures in this model. This is the starting point for statistical physics models, where e.g. nearest-neighbor interactions occur.

- We will first define the [[product space]] and state the properties we would like the product measure to have.
- Then, we will prove a special case of the [[Ionescu-Tulcea]] Theorem.
- Finally, we will prove the [[Kolmogorov Extension]] Theorem.
