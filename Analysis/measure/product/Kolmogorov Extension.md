> [!theorem] Kolmogorov Extension
> Let $\Omega_\alpha$ be Hausdorff spaces with Borel $\sigma$-fields $\FFF_\alpha$. Suppose we have a consistent family of finite-dimensional distributions $\{\PP_J\}$ such that $\PP_J$ is [[inner regular]] for all $J$. Then, there is a probability measure $\PP$ on the product space $(\Omega, \FFF) = \bigotimes_\alpha (\Omega_\alpha, \FFF_\alpha)$ with these finite-dimensional distributions $\PP_J$.

>In particular, if $\Omega_\alpha$ are Polish (separable metrizable) spaces, the $\PP_J$ are automatically inner regular, and this theorem automatically applies. This will be used to give initial definitions of [[Continuous Random Process Definitions|Continuous random processes]].

Quick comparison:

| | Kolmogorov | [[Ionescu-Tulcea]] |
|--- |--- | --- |
| Measurable spaces | Metric spaces + Borel fields | Anything |
| FD Marginals | Inner Regular | Product Measure |

# Proof

Let's do this later :) but the key idea is to follow the [[Standard Measure Construction]] again.
