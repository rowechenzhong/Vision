 The main intuition is that a product space should be independent in each of its projections.

We're sometimes interested in the sets
$$ \Omega_J = \prod_{\alpha \in J} \Omega_\alpha,\qquad \FFF_J = \bigotimes_{\alpha\in J} \FFF_\alpha$$ which are the partial products over subsets $J\subset I$; this will be standard notation.

# How we want the Product Measure to behave

The main intuition is that a product space should be independent in each of its projections.

We want these finite-dimensional marginals to all be self-consistent; if $J'\subset J\subset I$ are finite subsets, then the marginal $\PP_{J'}$ should be the same whether we project from $I$ to $J'$ or through $J$.
