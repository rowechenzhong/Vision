Let $E$ be a Hausdorff topological space. The $\sigma$-algebra generated by the set of open sets in $E$ is called the ==**Borel $\sigma$-algebra**== of $E$, and is denoted $\BBB(E)$. In the case of $\RR$, we sometimes denote it by $\BBB$. Then, any measure $\mu$ on $(E, \BBB(E))$ is called a ==**Borel measure**== on $E$.
