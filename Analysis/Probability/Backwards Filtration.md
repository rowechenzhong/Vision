Suppose $(\Omega, \FFF, \PP)$ is a probability space. A ==**backwards filtration**== of $\FFF$ is a sequence $(\hat{\FFF}_n)_{n\geq 0}$ of $\sigma$-algebras
$$
	  \hat{\FFF} \supseteq\hat{\FFF}_0 \supseteq \hat{\FFF}_1 \supseteq \dots
$$

We set $\hat{\FFF}_\infty = \bigcap\left(\hat{\FFF}_n : n\geq 0\right)$.
