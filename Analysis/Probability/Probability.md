### Main Results

A ==**Law of Large Numbers**== is of the following form: if $X, X_i$ are (some set of nice properties) random variables, for which $X_i\to X$ (somehow), the empirical means $\overline{X}_n = \frac1n \sum X_i$ converge to $\EE[X]$ (in some sense). Filling in the blanks of this intuitive statement in different ways yield theorems of differing levels of difficulty. Here are two possible routes:

**From the ground up:**
1. [[Stupid LLN]]
2. [[Weak LLN]]
3. [[Strong LLN elementary proof]]
**Through Ergodic Theory**:
- [[SLLN via Birkhoff and von Neumann]]
**Through Martingale Theory:**
- [[SLLN via Martingales]]

==**Cramer's Theorem**== states that large deviations from the sample average are exponentially unlikely.

The ==**Central Limit Theorem**== states that sample averages converge onto a normal distribution. It is essentially a direct consequence of Fourier analysis, and can be read immediately afterwards.
