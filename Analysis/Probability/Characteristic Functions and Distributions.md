Let $X$ be a random variable on $\RR^d$. Then the $\mu_X$ is uniquely determined by $\phi_X$. If $\phi_X$ is integrable, then $X$ admits continuous bounded PDF
$$f_X(x) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^d} \int_{\RR^d} \phi_X(u) e^{-i\braket{u|x}} \der u$$

This quickly yields [[Characteristic Functions and Weak Convergence]].
