A function $x:[0,\infty)\to \RR$ is ==**cadlag**== if it is right-continuous with left limits.

>[!idea] cadlag is a French acronym
>"continue à droite, limite à gauche."

The collection of càdlàg functions on a given domain is known as Skorokhod space; over $[0,\infty)$ it is denoted $D([0,\infty), \RR)$, and is endowed with the $\sigma$-algebra generated by the coordinate functions $\sigma(x\mapsto x_t: t\geq 0)$.

The main intuition is that [[super-martingales are naturally cadlag]].
