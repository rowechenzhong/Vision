This elementary theorem has a very [[Ergodic Theory|ergodic]] flavor.

> [!theorem] K$01$
> If $X_n$ are [[independence|independent]], then the [[tail sigma-algebra|tail $\sigma$-algebra]] $\mathfrak{T}$ contains only events of measure $0$ or $1$. In particular, any $\mathfrak{T}$-measurable RV is constant AS.

If $\FFF_n = \sigma(X_1,\dots X_n)$ as usual, $\FFF_n \pperp \mathfrak{T}_n\supset \mathfrak{T}$, thus $\FFF_\infty \pperp \mathfrak{T}$ are independent too. Thus $\mathfrak{T}\pperp \mathfrak{T}$. But this means if $A\in \mathfrak{T}$, $\PP(A) = \PP(A \cap A) = \PP(A)^2$ as desired.

A very funny proof, huh?
