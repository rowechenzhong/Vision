Consider a [[Adapted Continuous-Time Processes|progressive]] process $(X_t)_{t\geq 0}$, and let $T$ be a [[Continuous Time Stopping Times|stopping time]]. Then, $X_T(\omega) = X_{T(\omega)}(\omega)$, as a function $\{T < \infty\}\to (E,\GGG)$, is $\FFF_T$-measurable. This is clear, because it is the mapping $\{T < t\}\mapsto \{T < t\}\otimes \Omega\mapsto E$$$\omega\mapsto (T(\omega)\land t,\omega)\mapsto X_{T(\omega)\land t}(\omega).$$The first map is measurable by the universal property of the product category.
