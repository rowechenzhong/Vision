If a finitely additive set function on an algebra is "[[inner regular]]" with respect to a [[compact class]], it is countably additive.

>[!claim]
>Let $\mu$ be a finitely additive set function on an algebra $\AAA_0\subset 2^X$. If $\mathscr{C}$ is a compact subclass of $A$, and$$\forall E\in \AAA_0\qquad \mu(E) = \sup\{\mu(C): C\subset E, C\in \mathscr{C}\}$$then $\mu$ is a [[pre-measure]].

>[!example] Inner Regular Borel Measure
>Let $\AAA_0$ be the [[Borel Measure|borel $\sigma$-algebra]] and $\mathscr{C}$ be the compact sets.

>[!example] Lebesgue Measure
>Let $\AAA_0$ be the algebra generated by half-open intervals $[a,b)$. Let $\mu([a,b)) = b - a$ and extend linearly. This is clearly finitely additive. It is a pre-measure by the claim.

We use the [[pre-measure|pre-measure boostrap]] and give ourselves $2^{-\eps}$ room, then run it through.
