Let $O(M)$ be the set of $(d+1)$-tuples $(x, e_1,e_2,\dots, e_d)$ where $x\in M$ and $(e_1,\dots, e_d)$ is an orthonormal basis of $T_xM$. We write this as $[x,e]$ where $x\in M$ and $e = (e^k_i)$.

These form a bundle of orthonormal frames; $\pi:O(M)\to M$, add smoothness conditions, serve warm.

Note that $O(d)$ acts on $O(M)$ pointwise.
