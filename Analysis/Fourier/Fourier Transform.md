Basically the Fourier Transform allows us to switch between a convolutional and multiplicative domain. It is generically a unitary transformation, which means it preserves an appropriate inner product, and has its adjoint as an inverse.

There are many forms of the Fourier transform, corresponding to different mathematical objects.
