The ==**mesh**== of a partition $X = \bigcup X_i$ is $\sup_i \abs{X_i}$, for some suitable definition of $\abs{\bullet}$. For instance, in measure theory, $\abs{\bullet}$ is usually taken to be the measure of the set.

When I say "given a mesh" when an interval $[a,b]$ is clear, I will mean a construction of the following form: construct a sequence of subdivisions of $[a,b]$, $a = t_0^n < t_1^n < \dots < t_{p_n}^n = b$ whose mesh tends to $0$.
