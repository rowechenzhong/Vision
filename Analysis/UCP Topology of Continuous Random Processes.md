The space of continuous functions $[0,\infty)\to \RR$ admits a metrizable topology, where $f_n\to f$ iff for all $t > 0$, $\sup_{s\leq t} \abs{f_n(s) - f(s)}\to 0$ as $n\to \infty$.

>$C([0,\infty),\RR)$ inherits a $\sigma$-algebra by restricting$\left.\BBB_\RR^{\otimes I}\right\vert_{C([0,\infty), \RR)}$ (i.e., $\{E\cap C([0,\infty), \RR): E\in \BBB^{\otimes I}_\RR$. This is equal to the $\sigma$-algebra generated by the UCP topology.

If we extend this to continuous stochastic processes via convergence in the probability, we obtain the ==**uniform convergence on compacts in probability**== topology.
