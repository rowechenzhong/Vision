# Main Sequence

First, one should review some [[Review|foundational concepts]].

Then, we define the main players in full generality.
- [[normed]]
- [[banach]]
- [[normed subspaces|subspaces]]
- [[operators]]

The key results are presented:
- [[zabreikos]]
- [[hahnbanach]]

Deep dive into Hilbert spaces:
- [[hilbert]]
- [[adjoint]]
- [[compact]]
- [[eigen]]
