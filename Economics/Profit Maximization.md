The ==**elasticity of demand**== is $e_{q,p} = \frac{d \ln q}{d\ln p}$; note this is usually negative. An increase in price leads to a $-e_{q,p}$ decrease in quantity. Hence marginal revenue to increasing quantity is $p\left(1 + \frac{1}{e_{q,p}}\right)$.

The marginal revenue is below the demand curve;

The ==**markup**== is $\frac{p - MC}{p}$, the increase in price relative to marginal cost; it is exactly $-\frac{1}{e_{q,p}}$. In a world where people are willing to buy large amounts of stuff ($e_{q,p}$ very small (but still negative)) then the markup can be massive.

The profit is just $\pi^*(p, v, w) = \max_{k, \ell} \pi(p, v, w, k, \ell) = \max_{k, \ell}  p f(k, \ell) - w \ell - vk$. 

==**Hotelling's Lemma**== says $q^* = f(k^*, \ell^*) = \frac{\pa \pi^*}{\pa p}$; this is by envelope. Explicitly, hold $v,w$ constant forever and move $p$; $\frac{\pa \pi^*}{\pa p} = \frac{d}{dp} \pi(p,w,k,\ell) = \frac{\pa \pi}{\pa p} = q^*$ because everything else is presumed extremized.

Similarly, $\ell^* = - \frac{\pa \pi^*}{\pa w}$ etc.
