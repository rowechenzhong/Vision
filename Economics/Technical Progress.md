Suppose $q = A(t) f(k,\ell)$ where $A$ represents multiplicative technological improvements.

We see$$
\frac{d\ln q}{dt} = \frac{d\ln A}{dt} + \frac{\pa \ln f}{\pa \ln k} \frac{d \ln k}{d t} + \frac{\pa \ln f}{\pa \ln \ell} \frac{d \ln \ell}{d t}.
$$
The second two weights $\frac{\pa \ln f}{\pa \ln *}$ are the elasticities of output wrt the two inputs.
