# Labor Market
We have been looking at the short-run I guess by assuming constant price levels in the IS-LM model. Now we're in the medium run.

The aggregate nominal wage $W = P^e F(u,z)$. Workers only care about the real wages $\frac{W}{P^e}$ which are somewhat in the future.
- Expected price level $P^e$, unemployment rate $u$. $\frac{\pa F}{\pa u} < 0$ because unemployment is the supply to the labor market.
- Catch-all variable $z$, for unemployment insurance or employment protection. Unclear.

The prices set by firms depend on their production function or output $Y = AN$
- $A$ is the labor productivity. For some reason, we assume that this is $1$; I suppose the units of the LHS and RHS are not equal so we can fix this? But perhaps this changes over time? Confusing.
- $N$ is employment.
In this case, the marginal cost of producing more $Y$ is $AW$, and firms will generically charge a markup $m$ such that $P = (1 + m)AW$.

Anyways, we obtain a ==**price-setting relation**== $\frac{W}{P} = \frac{1}{1 + m}$ which should equal the wage-setting relation $\frac{W}{P} = F(u,z)$ at equilibrium; this solves for the ==**natural unemployment rate**== $u_n$ (in terms of $z$ which we're ignoring). This equilibrium is achieved in the medium run, but probably off in the short run.
