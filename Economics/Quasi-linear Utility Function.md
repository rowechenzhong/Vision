If your utility function includes money or a linear function of money, then your indirect utility will be of the form $v(p) + I$.

Indeed, if your utility function looks like $u(x, x_1,\dots, x_n) = x + \theta(x_1,\dots, x_n)$ at prices $p_0, p_1,\dots, p_n$, then by Lagrange multipliers, we obtain $x^*_i = \left(\frac{\pa \theta}{\pa x_i}\right)^{-1}\left(\frac{p_i}{p}\right)$ for each $i\geq 1$ and $x = \frac{I - \sum p_ix_i}{p}$. 

We almost always make the assumption of a quasilinear utility function; when looking at agents with zero market impact, the exogenous prices can be tucked away into the constant $v(p)$ term. This simplifies the analysis.

The [[Expenditure Function|Hicksian Demand]] and [[Utility functions|Marshallian Demand]] coincide on these utility functions.
