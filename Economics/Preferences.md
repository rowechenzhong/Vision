You know everything, but they like to add a continuity axiom to the definition of a rational preference function.
**Revealed Preference**: If a consumer chooses a bundle $(x_a, y_a)$ over $(x_b, y_b)$, given both are affordable under the budget constraint $p_x x_b + p_y y_b < I$, then $(x_a, y_a)$ is "revealed preferred" to $(x_b, y_b)$.

Demand functions are consistent with utility maximization if they satisfy the following:
1. **Adding Up Condition**: The entire budget is spent, i.e., $p_x x(p_x, p_y, I) + p_y y(p_x, p_y, I) = I$.
2. **Homogeneity of Degree 0**: Demand functions should not change if prices and income change proportionally. In other words, $x(k p_x, k p_y, k I) = x(p_x, p_y, I)$ for any $k > 0$.
3. ==**Strong Axiom of Revealed Preference (SARP)**==: There cannot be a situation where $(x_a, y_a)$ is revealed preferred to $(x_b, y_b)$, which in turn is revealed preferred to $(x_c, y_c)$, and so on, eventually leading back to $(x_a, y_a)$.
