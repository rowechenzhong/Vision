Alright, what the hell is going on right now.

>[!definition] Supply Curve, Demand Curve

>- The Demand Curve says, given some price, how much of this product are consumers willing to eat. It is non-increasing.

Both the supply and demand curves show the marginal value. The utility function for consumers per-unit is concave down, and if you place some price, then the best orders get filled.

The ==**Consumer Surplus**== is $CS = \int_0^{q_0} \left(u'(x) - p\right)dx$. which is the amount that consumers gain in net. It is $\max_q u(q) - pq$.


Their intersection is the ==**market equilibrium**==. Here are some things that can *shift* the curves (the curves themselves move):
- Shocks to the ability of producers to supply. (New tech? Supply chain deadge?)
- Shocks in consumer tastes (bro people don't like apples anymore)
- Shocks to the price of complement/substitute goods.
	- A ==**complement good**== is something that increases the utility super-additively when consumed with another item i.e. bread + deli meat or something.
	- A ==**substitute good**== is something serves the same purposes as a different good, i.e. lays and doritos or smth.
	- The point is, if Deli meat prices go up, bread prices will go DOWN because people don't want them anymore. If doritos prices go up, lays prices will go UP because people want them more.

An increase in income usually increases demand for goods, e.g. nice cars; these are called ==**normal goods**==. Otherwise, they are called ==**inferior goods**==.

Like, there's causes and effects bonk. Minimum wage increases causes unemployment (todo: why? I think in the unemployment case there's actually like a bunch of separate markets or something)

Similarly, all of these things occur for demands as well.
- A ==**complement in supply**== is like leather and beef: increasing the price of beef will increase the quantity of beef produced, thus increasing the quantity of leather produced and lowering its price.
- A ==**substitute in supply**== is like corn and wheat: increasing the price of corn will increase the quantity of corn produced, but this takes away land from wheat, so the quantity of wheat produced will decrease, and the price of wheat will increase as well.

# Market Demand and Supply

If you have a bunch of individuals in the market with their own supply curves, add them by price ("horizontal adding" lol). Ditto for demand.

# Market Equilibrium

Just think.
