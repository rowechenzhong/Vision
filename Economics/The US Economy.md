300M people in the US, mostly white.

# Production (Macro!)

We get our income by providing goods and services.

The income $Y$ is spent on consumption $C$, investment $I$, and government $G$. There are also imports $M$ and exports $X$ which mean we are not net zero.

So $Y = C + I + G + (X - M)$. Something like that.

Output is measured by GFP, which is the value of ==**traded goods and services produced within the borders of the US**==. It excludes non-traded G + S, including unpaid housework. GDP goes up if you and your neighbor exchange money.

# Government

The government is around $20\%$ of the US economy.

# Trade

We have been in trade deficit since the 1970s.
