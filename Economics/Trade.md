# Production Possibilities Frontier
Specialization is OP.

# Comparative and Absolute Advantage

Only comparative advantage (ratios) matters. Absolute advantage is stupid. Trade permits the production of more of all goods!

# Factors of Production

These are inputs to the production process.

There are two types:

| Fixed                      | Mobile  |
| -------------------------- | ------- |
| Labor                      | Capital |
| Temperature, Weather, Land |         |
| Water/Coal                 |         |

Fixed factors can give particular regions a comparative advantage.

The ==**Ricardian theory**== says that countries will specialize in production according to comparative advantage (this makes sense). This fails to capture some of the politics IRL, but it works for the most part.

# International Trade

Perspective: when the US exports a computer to Mexico, American labor has been sold abroad. It can be useful to think about international trade as the trading of these inputs.

==**Factor price equalization**== claims that free trade should act to equalize the value of factors of production between states. This barely works in practice.
