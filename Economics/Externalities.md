An ==**externality**== is an effect on parties not involved in a transaction. A vanilla competitive market will not yield socially efficient outcomes when externalities are present; this is ==**market failure**==.

Given a negative externality e.g. pollution due to a paper mill, there will be ==**external costs**== in addition to the usual ==**private costs**==. Adding these (marginally) yields the ==**social costs**==. This yields a dead weight loss; the market has no reason to care about the external costs, because it doesn't even know they exist.

Generically, we add the negative externalities to the supply ("private marginal cost" -> "marginal social cost") (recall that the supply curve is roughly "how much money do I need to get paid to justify supplying marginally more at $q$; if there are negative externalities, then the "societal producer" would need to be paid more) and add the positive externalities to the demand ("marginal private benefit" -> "marginal social benefit"). This is essentially a convention because the price is only well-defined up to constant ("societal producer" and "societal consumer?") and the quantity is what matters.

A super common example is the ==**tragedy of the commons**==, which is in full generality the overuse of a resource because of ignorance of some harmful effect on other users.

# Pigouvian Taxes

Make a constant per-unit tax to lift the private marginal cost such that it intersects the marginal benefit at the socially efficient quantity. Here, the thing in question has a negative externality, yielding this tax.

The converse is the ==**Pigouvian Subsidy**==, which lowers the private marginal cost to the same effect.

The technical problem with this is that it's hard for the government to compute the externality preciselly.

The political problem with this is that it affects the government bankroll, so obviously there could be conflict of interest (both for subsidies and taxes; the government wants taxes, and interest parties might sway the allocation of subsidies).

# Quotas against Externalities

These also address the problem + do not let the government touch the money. The problem here is that quotas often misallocate the resource. Quotas tend to harm new entrants compared to existing firms, and often do not update optimally to new technology.

# Tradable Permits

Efficient exchange -- both the obvious one, which is that SO2 permits can be exchanged optimally between power plants (say), but also that environmental groups can purchase them by themselves, which aligns the price more closely with the negative externality.

So, all-in-all, we get a taxation scheme without needing to estimate the social cost directly, because the market does it for you.

# Coasian Bargaining

Coasian Bargaining is GTO if property rights are clearly defined. Suppose Alice and Bob live in adjacent dorm rooms and Alice plays loud music (which she enjoys and Bob dislikes). If Alice owns the right to play loud music, Bob will pay Alice until an efficient solution is reached, and vice-versa. In the case of SO2, it is unclear who owns the air. So yeah, we all believe Coase, the problem is that property rights are not clearly defined IRL.
