A Public Good is:
- ==**Nonexcludable**==: the producer cannot prevent the use of the good by others.
- ==**Nonrivalrous**==: many customers can use it simultaneously without affecting each other.

By default, the social optimum is not the same as the market equilibrium. Duh. This is called the ==**free-rider problem**== in this case; you don't do anything, because you don't measure the marginal impact you make on others.

> The utility of a park of size $S$ to a household is $S^bn^{-a}$ where $0 < a \leq b < 1$. $S$ is equal to the size of the contribution of each household. A socially optimal park has size $S^* = \left(bn^{1-a}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-b}}$ yielding net utility $\left(b^bn^{b-a}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-b}}$. An equilibrium park has size $S_0 = \left(bn^{-a}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-b}}$ which is much smaller, yielding net utility $\left(b^bn^{-a}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-b}}$.

Taxation solves this, if some omniscient being prescribes the tax. If you don't have any omniscient beings, then a voting procedure will do; this is generally better than voluntary but worse than GTO (with oracle).

# Local Public Goods

The world is partitioned, and agents can freely move between these partitions or something. Each partition has its own ==**local public goods**== which exclude other partitions. This happens IRL with like, cities; you don't travel to a different city and use their park (often).

This Charles Tiebout guy observes that if you want your voting-based method to work well, you want a population with a relatively homogenous utility function. This can be achieved if you have local public goods, because the members of partitions will generally be similar (they all decided to be in this partition).
