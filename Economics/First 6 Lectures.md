Here is a summary of each lecture with key equations, highlighting the important concepts while discarding examples:

### Lecture 1: Introduction to Macroeconomics
- **Macroeconomics** studies aggregate economic activity and addresses key questions like what determines the size of economies, growth, unemployment, inflation, and exchange rates.
- **Key Topics:**
  - **The Crisis**: Post-2007 U.S. housing crisis led to a global economic downturn.
  - **National economies** (e.g., U.S., Eurozone, China) with varying growth, inflation, and unemployment rates.
  - **Output and Unemployment**: Macroeconomics studies these metrics across different countries.
- **Equations**:
  - Growth Rate: $g_t = \frac{Y_t - Y_{t-1}}{Y_{t-1}}$
  - Inflation Rate: $\pi_t = \frac{P_t - P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}}$

Why did the Federal Funds rate stop at zero?
- This constraint is known as the zero lower bound.
- If it were negative, then everyone would hold cash rather
than bonds.
Why are low interest rates a potential issue?
- Low interest rates limit the Fedâ€™s ability to respond to
further negative shocks. (At the zero lower bound, this is called the **liquidity trap**).
- Low interest rates may lead to excessive risk taking by
investors to increase their returns.

### Lecture 2: Basic Macroeconomic Concepts
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **GDP** is:
	  - **Total value** of final goods and services produced. 
	  - **The Sum of Value Added** by each firm; the VA by a firm is the value of its production minus all intermediate goods.
	  - **Sum of incomes in the economy**: labor income (wages) and capital (also called profit) income.
  - **Nominal GDP** vs. **Real GDP**: 
    - Nominal GDP is valued at current prices, while Real GDP is adjusted for inflation; we measure in **chained (2009) dollars**; we only care about real GDP and denote it as $Y_t$; nominal GDP is denoted as $\$Y_t$.
    - DoC deals with change in quality by **Hedonic pricing**.
  - **Unemployment Rate**: Measures the percentage of people without a job but actively seeking work.
	  - $L = N + U$ Labor Force is Employment and Unemployment.
	  - Some workers are **discouraged** meaning they do not look for job.
  - **Inflation**: Sustained rise in the price level, measured using price indices such as the GDP deflator and the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
- **Equations**:
  - GDP growth is trivial $\frac{Y_t - Y_{t-1}}{Y_{t-1}}$.
  - GDP Deflator: $P_t = \frac{\text{Nominal GDP}_t}{\text{Real GDP}_t}$
  - Inflation: $\pi_t = \frac{P_t - P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}}$
  - Unemployment Rate: $u_t = \frac{\text{Unemployed}}{\text{Labor Force}}$, Participation rate is labor force over total population.
  - Okun's Law: $\Delta u = -0.4(\Delta \text{GDP growth})$, intercept at output growth of 3\% to keep unemployment constant.

- Phillips Curve: change in inflation is around constant when unemployment at 6\%, with a negative slope.

### Lecture 3: The Goods Market
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Aggregate Demand**: Defined by $Z = C + I + G + X - IM$, where $Z$ is the demand for goods.
  - **Consumption Function**: $C = c_0 + c_1(Y_D)$, where $Y_D = Y - T$ is disposable income.
  - **Equilibrium Output**: Occurs when production $Y$ equals aggregate demand $Z$.
- **Equations**:
  - Equilibrium: $Y = \frac{1}{1 - c_1}(c_0 + \bar{I} + G - c_1 T)$
  - Autonomous Spending: $\text{Autonomous Spending} = c_0 + \bar{I} + G - c_1T$
  - Multiplier: $\text{Multiplier} = \frac{1}{1 - c_1}$

### Lecture 4: Financial Markets
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Demand for Money**: $M_d = P Y L(i)$, where $L(i)$ is a decreasing function of the interest rate.
  - **Money Supply**: Controlled by the central bank through open market operations.
  - **Interest Rate Determination**: Equilibrium in financial markets sets the interest rate.
  - **Liquidity Trap**: Occurs when interest rates are at zero, limiting monetary policy.
- **Equations**:
  - Money Demand: $M_d = \$ Y\cdot  L(i)$ where $L(i)$ is a decreasing function.
  - Interest Rate (Bond Pricing): $i = \frac{100 - P_B}{P_B}$
  - Liquidity Trap: At $i = 0$, money and bonds are perfect substitutes.

Money are used for transactions, but it pays no interest.
- Two types of money: currency and checkable deposits.
- Bonds pay a positive interest rate, i (the rate of interest), but cannot be used for transaction.

### Lecture 5: IS-LM Model
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **IS Curve**: Represents equilibrium in the goods market where $Y = C(Y - T) + I(Y, i) + G$.
  - **LM Curve**: Represents equilibrium in the financial market where real money demand equals supply $M/P = L(i, Y)$.
  - **Fiscal and Monetary Policy**: Changes in government spending/taxes shift the IS curve, while changes in money supply shift the LM curve.
- **Equations**:
  - IS Relation: $Y = C(Y - T) + I(Y, i) + G$
  - LM Relation: $M/P = Y L(i)$
  - Fiscal Policy: $G - T$
  - Monetary Policy: $M$

### Lecture 6: Extended IS-LM Model
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Financial Markets**: Introduces the risk premium ($x$) and probability of default ($p$).
  - **Real Interest Rate**: Central bank controls the real policy rate, affecting borrowing rates.
  - **Financial Crises**: IS curve shifts left during crises, leading to lower output.
  - **Risk Premium Equation**:
    $x = \frac{(1 + i)p}{1 - p}$
- **Equations**:
  - Real Interest Rate: $r = i - \pi_e$
  - Risk Premium: $x = \frac{(1 + i)p}{1 - p}$

These summaries provide the most essential macroeconomic principles and key equations covered in each lecture.
