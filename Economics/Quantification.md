# Own Price Elasticity

>[!definition] Elasticity
>Let $x(p)$ be the quantity purchased (demanded) with the price is $p$. The unit-free responsiveness of price to demand is called ==**elasticity**==,

To first-order, if demand uniformly scales by $1+\Delta$, then quantity rises by $\frac{\eta \Delta}{\eps + \eta}$ and price rises by $\frac{\Delta}{\eps + \eta}$. Whatever.

>[!idea] 14.04 Conventions
>This is called ==**own price elasticity**== and there is no negative sign.

There is also ==**income elasticity**== which is $\frac{I}{x} \frac{\pa x^*}{\pa I}$ and ==**cross price elasticity**== $\frac{p_y}{x} \frac{\pa x^*}{\pa p_y}$.
1. Income elasticity is a measure of whether a good is inferior, normal, or luxury.
2. A Giffen good is ==**a product or service that people buy more of as the price increases, which goes against the law of demand**==. The term was named after Scottish economist Sir Robert Giffen, who noticed this phenomenon during the Victorian era; the own-price elasticity is *positive*.
3. Cross price elasticity measures substitutes and complements.
