Note that $\ZZ = \ZZ[\{*\}]$ is a $\ZZ[G]$ module in the sense that all the group elements do nothing. Thus, given a $\ZZ[G]$ module $A$, $$\ZZ\otimes_{\ZZ[G]} A = A / (g(a)\sim a).$$This is called the ==**coinvariants of the action**==.

>[!example] Coinvariants of a free group
>If $A$ was a free group over $\ZZ[G]$, the coinvariants $\ZZ\otimes_{\ZZ[G]} A$ form a free group. Indeed, the basis $e_{g, \lambda}$ collapses to $e_\lambda$.
