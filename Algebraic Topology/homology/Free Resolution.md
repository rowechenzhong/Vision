Let $A$ be a $\ZZ G$-module. A ==**free resolution**== of $\ZZ$ is a chain complex $C$ such that:
- Each $C_n$ is a free $\ZZ G$-module, and $\pa$ commutes with $G$-actions.
- $C_n = 0$ for $n < 0$.
- $H_0(C) = C_0 / \im(\pa_1)$ is isomorphic to $A$ as a $\ZZ G$-module.
- $H_n(C) = 0$ for all $n > 0$.

>Intuitively: Take $A$, and somehow "resolve" it without creating any homology groups. I'm not sure what the geometric picture is here.
