# One Perspective

Sometimes, we like to figure out things about a set by analyzing some "free abelian group" generated by this set. See: representation theory, where we learn a lot about $G$ by thinking about $\CC[G]$. Representation theory of finite groups is fun and easy because we can dump the massive amount of intuition we have about inner product spaces onto an unsuspecting finite group and compute everything about it.

From this perspective, homotopy theory is doing things all wrong; they've got a couple too many relations lying around for us to be able to import any massive amounts of theory.

Homology theory considers a free abelian group generated certain objects in *entire topological spaces*; as such, the groups in question are usually massive. But we can dump the massive amount of intuition we have about *commutative algebra* (which we might not have yet, oops! but it exists! and a lot of it looks just like vector spaces! i personally enjoyed learning about all of the commutative algebra stuff, it's very pretty) on unsuspecting topological spaces and conclude deep facts like $\RR^m \equiv \RR^n\iff m = n$.

# Two Perspective

Todo: waffle about holes.
