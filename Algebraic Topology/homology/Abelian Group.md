An ==**abelian group**== is a commutative group.

### Torsion Elements
A ==**torsion element**== is an element with finite order.

These form a subgroup for known reasons.

### Infinite Direct Sums and Products
The difference is that a direct sum has cofinitely many $0$'s, while a direct product is on the full Cartesian product.

### Free group
In mathematics, a free abelian group is an abelian group with a basis. Being an abelian group means that it is a set with an addition operation that is associative, commutative, and invertible. A basis, also called an integral basis, is a subset such that every element of the group can be uniquely expressed as an integer combination of finitely many basis elements.

**Any subgroup of a free abelian group is free, and a direct product of countably many copies of $\ZZ$ is not free**.

### Cat words
Homomorphisms, kernels, images, and cokernels work as usual. The cokernel, in case you forgot, of $\phi:A\to B$, is $B / \im\phi$.
