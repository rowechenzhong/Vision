A common situation is the below commutative diagram.

The claim is that
$$\pa_A \psi_1^{-1} B_1 \subseteq \psi_0^{-1} \pa_B B_1$$
Consider the set $\psi_0^{-1} \pa_B B_1$. This consists of elements $x$ such that there exists an element $c$ such that $\pa_B c = \psi_0 x$. Consider next the set $\pa_A \psi_1^{-1} B_1$. This consists of $\{\pa_A a\}$ for all $a$ such that there exists a $b$ such that $\psi_1(a) = b$.

This is a subset of the previous, because $\psi_0 \pa_A a = \pa_B \psi_1 a$, thus $c = \psi_1 a$ fits the bill.
