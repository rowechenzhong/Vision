A ==**$\Delta$-complex**== on a space $X$ is a collection of maps $\{\sigma_\alpha:\Delta^{n_\alpha}\to X\}_{\alpha\in I}$ such that:
 - $\sigma_\alpha\big\vert \mathring{\Delta}^n$ is injective. Moreover, if $U = \bigcup \mathring{\Delta}^{n_\alpha}$, $\sigma_\alpha\big\vert U$ is injective.
 - For each $\sigma_\alpha: \Delta^n\to X$, for all faces $\phi: \Delta^{n-1}\to \Delta^n$ (canonical linear homomorphism), the there is a map $\sigma_\beta: \Delta^{n-1}\to X$ which is exactly the restriction $\sigma_\alpha \big\vert \Delta^{n-1}$.
 - A set $A\subset X$ is open iff $\sigma^{-1}_\alpha(A)$ is open in $\Delta^n$ for each $\sigma_\alpha$.

Alternatively: $X$ is a quotient space of a collection of disjoint simplices $\Delta^n_\alpha$. Each simplex identifies its faces with a collection of other simplices. These indentifications must preserve orientation.

For an alternative perspective which reads more combinatorially, see [[semi-simplicial set]].
