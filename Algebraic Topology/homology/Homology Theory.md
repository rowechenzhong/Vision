This is the [[homepage]] for Homology Theory.

# Main Sequence

### Initial Attempts
1. [[What is Homology|What is Homology?]]
2. [[Simplicial Homology]]
3. [[Singular Homology]]

### A bunch of algebra
3. [[Commutative Diagram]]
4. Some topics:
	- [[Abelian Group]]
	- [[Chain Complexes]] and basic things you can do with them
		- [[Chain Map]]
		- [[Chain Homotopy]]
		- [[Chain Homotopy Equivalence]]
	- [[Exact Sequences]]
		- One can [[fracture a long exact sequence into short exact sequences]]. This is why we care about short exact sequences so much.
	- [[Free Abelian Chain Complexes]] are very good.

### Dictionaries
5. [[homotopic maps induce homotopic chain maps]]
6. [[Complexes and Covering Maps|covering maps and homology]]

### A bunch more algebra
7. [[ZG module]] and [[Coinvariants of a ZG module]]
8. [[Inverting a Square]]
9. [[Short exact sequence of chain complexes implies long exact sequence of homology groups]]
10. [[Five lemma]]
11. [[Mapping Cone]]
