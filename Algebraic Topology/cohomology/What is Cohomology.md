  - What is Cohomology?
---
My current intuition is that an element of $H^i$ looks like a differential form (yes, motivated by de Rham cohomology, because all the topological spaces I care about are smooth manifolds). This makes sense, because differential forms can eat chains by integration. More precisely, the singular cohomology groups are isomorphic to the de Rham cohomology groups, which is the content of De Rham's theorem. This makes sense, because if your space contains say a finite collection of holes, then the only interesting submanifolds to take integrals over are the homology classes -- when working over $\RR^2\setminus \{0\}$, the only interesting loop integral is the one around $\{0\}$. My intuition is strongly reliant on the universal coefficient theorem trivializing over fields.

Hopefully I can work out all of the details at some point.
