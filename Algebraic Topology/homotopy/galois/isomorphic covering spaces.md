> [!definition] Isomorphic Covering Spaces
 Two [[covering spaces]] $p_1: \tilde{X}_1\to X$ and $p_2: \tilde{X}_2\to X$ are ==**isomorphic**== if there exists a homeomorphism $\phi: \tilde{X}_1\to \tilde{X}_2$ such that $p_2\circ \phi = p_1$. If we specified basepoints on each of these spaces, then we require $\phi(\tilde{x}_1) = \tilde{x}_2$. 

 This is clearly an equivalence relation.

 As sets, $\phi( p^{-1}_1(x)) = p^{-1}_2(x)$. I can hot-swap all $\tilde x\in \tilde{X}_1$ with $\phi(\tilde x)\in \tilde{X}_2$, and all computations remain unchanged. **Isomorphic covering spaces are indistinguishable.**
