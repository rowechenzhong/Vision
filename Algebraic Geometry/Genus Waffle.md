Here's a waffle.

Consider cubic $y^2 = x(x-1)(x-\lambda)$ over $\CC\PP^2$. It intersects the line at infinity at some point $\infty$. This looks like some dimension-$2$ manifold. Consider it as a $2$-sheeted covering of $\CC\PP$ via $y\mapsto \sqrt{x(x-1)(x-\lambda)}$ and $\infty\to \infty$. The sheets touch at $\{0,1,\lambda, \infty\}$. Locally around those touch points, it looks like a $x^{1/2}$ (or $x^{3/2}$). Hence, we draw lines from $0\to 1$ and $\lambda\to \infty$ on $\CC\PP\sim S^2$. Open the lines and connect the sheets; its a torus with genus $1$.

Such things are deep.
