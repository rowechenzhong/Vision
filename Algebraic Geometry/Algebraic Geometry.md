This is the [[homepage]] for Algebraic Geometry.

I will mainly be following [UAG.pdf (warwick.ac.uk)](https://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/staff/Miles.Reid/MA4A5/UAG.pdf) (Miles, first pass) and [(PDF) Introduction to Algebraic Geometry (researchgate.net)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270283181_Introduction_to_Algebraic_Geometry) (Smith, second pass).
