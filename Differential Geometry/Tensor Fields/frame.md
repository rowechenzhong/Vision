>[!problem]
>Show that a vector bundle $p:E\to X$ is trivial (isomorphic to $X\times k^n$) iff it admits [[Section|sections]] which form a basis in every fiber. Such a collection of sections is called a ==**frame**==.

>[!solution]- This is dumb
>If you are trivial, then fine, pick your stupid basis.
>
>If you have a basis in ever fiber, then those sections tell you your isomorphism.

>[!example]
>For example, $S^1$ admits a frame. If two vector bundles $p:E\to X$ and $q:F\to Y$ admit frames, then so does $p\times q: E\times F\to X\times Y$.

>[!idea]
>Any $S^{2m}$ does not admit a frame, because by the Hairy Ball theorem, they don't even have a single nonwhere-vanishing vector field.
