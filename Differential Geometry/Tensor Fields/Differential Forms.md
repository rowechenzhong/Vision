A ==**differential $m$-form**== on $X$ is a skew-symmetric tensor field of rank $(0,m)$.

If $f\in O(X)$ is a regular function, then we have differential $1$-form $df$ given by $df(x) = d_xf$ (recall that $d_xf: T_xX\to k$). A generic $1$-form can be written in local coordinates as
$$
	\omega(x) = \sum_i a_i(x) dx_i(x)
$$
