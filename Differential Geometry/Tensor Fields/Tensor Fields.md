Now that we have [[Vector Fields]], one can do things like duals, tensor products ,and symmetric/exterior powers on them. A ==**tensor field**== of rank $(k,m)$ on a manifold $X$ is a section of the tensor product $(TX)^{\otimes k} \otimes (T^*X)^{\otimes m}$.

>[!example]
>The ==**Cotangent Bundle**== $T^*X$ is the dual to the tangent bundle $TX$ (locally, it looks like $X\times V^\vee$).

In this case, the clutching functions on two overlapping coordinate systems would be the inverse of the Jacobi matrix of the change of variables, as expected.

>[!example] Differential Form
>A skew-symmetric tensor field of rank $(0,m)$ (a sectoion of $\Lambda^m T^*X$) is just a ==**differential $m$-form**==!

More on [[Differential Forms]] here.

Of course we can talk about ==**tensor bundles**== which are just $\Gamma(X, V^{\otimes p}\otimes (V^\vee)^{\otimes q})$.
