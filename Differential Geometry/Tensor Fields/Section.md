A ==**section**== of a map $p:E\to X$ is a map $s:X\to E$ such that $p\circ s(x) = x$ for all $x\in X$.

This is just how one extracts a function from a graph in a basis-free way. Generally we use this in the context of [[Fiber Bundle|fiber bundles]], in which case $p$ should have the same regularity as the underlying manifolds.

# Sections of Vector Bundles

The collection of all possible sections on a vector bundle is denoted $\Gamma(X,E)$; a ==**vector field**== is a section of the [[Tangent Bundle|tangent bundle]] $TX$.
