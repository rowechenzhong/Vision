>[!definition] Fiber Bundle
 Consider a regular map of manifolds $p:Y\to X$. Suppose there exists a manifold $F$ such that each $x\in X$ admits a neighborhood $U$ such that there is a diffeomorphism
> $$
>	h:U\times F\cong p^{-1}(U)
> $$
> such that $p\circ h(u,f) = u$.
> 
> Then, the $p$ is called a  ==**locally trivial fibration**== (or ==**fiber bundle**==) with:
> - ==**base**== $X$
> - ==**total space**== $Y$
> - ==**fiber**== $F$

>[!idea] Projection
> Locally, $p$ looks like the projection $X\times F\to X$ (the trivial fiber bundle with fiber $F$ over $X$), but not necessarily globally so. This generalizes the notion of a covering, in which case $F$ is $0$-dimensional (discrete).

This is like, not that deep.
