This is just a section of $TX$.

Locally, you can write coordinates corresponding to the coordinates on $T_pX$, which are just the partial derivatives. Then the clutching function between two coordinate systems is just the Jacobi matrix of the change of variables at that point (this is completely intuitive).

A manifold $X$ is called ==**parallelizable**== if its tangent bundle is trivial; this holds iff it admits a [[frame]].
