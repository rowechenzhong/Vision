A continuous map $F:X\to Y$ between manifolds (of the same regularity class) is ==**regular**== if, for any [[Regular Functions|regular function]] $h$ on an open set $U\subset Y$, the function $h\circ F$ on $F^{-1}(U)$ is regular.

Composition works, and if $F$ is a homeomorphism where $F$, $F^{-1}$ are both regular, then $F$ is a diffeomorphism.

We now have differentiation structure, so we can define the [[Differential]] of $F$ at $P$.
