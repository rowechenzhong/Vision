This is the [[homepage]] for differential geometry.

Everything is very easy here, so we'll move quickly. All vector spaces are normed over $\RR$. Most things are created purely as setup for [[Lie/Lie Groups]].

# Sequences
1. [[Derivative]]
2. [[implicit function theorem]] (TODO)
3. [[topological manifolds]]
4. [[Inverse Function Theorem]] (TODO)

## Smooth Manifolds

>[!idea]
>Starting here, a manifold must be smooth, RA, or CA.

We set up calculus on manifolds.
10. [[Derivation]]
11. [[Tangent spaces]]
12. [[Regular Maps]]
13. [[Differential]]

We explore the varieties of submanifolds.
1. [[Submersion]]
2. [[Immersion]]
3. [[Embedding]]
4. [[Immersed Submanifold]]

Then we discuss Fiber Bundles.
5. [[Fiber Bundle]]
6. [[Tensor Fields]]

# Pseudo-Riemannian Geometry Crash-Course

1. [[Reminders on Riemannian manifolds]] except they're not reminders because I don't understand anything.
2. [[Reminders on Orthonormal Frame Bundles]] oh hey I guess these are just bundle bois. (This was for [[Stochastic Differential Geometry]])
3. [[affine connection, what are Levi and Civita waffling bout, plus RCT]]
4. [[Cartan's Magic Formula]]
