On (smooth/RA) manifolds $X$, a ==**derivation at**== $P$ is a functional on [[Germ|germs]] $D: O_P\to \RR$. This must satisfy the ==**Leibniz rule**==
$$
	D(fg) = D(f)g(P) + f(P)D(g)
$$
In particular, $D(1) = 0$.

(Ditto for CA manifolds).

A ==**derivation on $U$**== for some open set $U$ is a linear map $O(U)\to O(U)$ satisfying the Leibniz rule pointwise;
$$
D(fg)(x) = (D(f))(x)\cdot g(x) + f(x)\cdot (D(g))(x)
$$
