Here's a black-boxed but obvious result which makes a lot of other results easy:

>[!theorem]
>Suppose a differentiable map $f:M\to N$ between manifolds has rank $k$ in some neighborhood of $p$ in $M$. Then, for all $p$ in $M$, there exist coordinates charts on $p$ and $f(p)$ such that $f(x^1,\dots, x^m) = (x^1,\dots, x^k,0,\dots, 0$.
