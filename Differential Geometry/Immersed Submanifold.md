An [[Immersion]] is sort of weak because it doesn't even have to be injective. Well, an ==**immersed submanifold**== is the image of an injective immersion. The image inherits a manifold (topological) structure coming from the *source of the immersion*, which is not necessarily compatible with the topology of the codomain.

This is weaker than being an [[Embedding]].
