> [!example] Line with two origins
> Consider $\RR\times \{0,1\}/\sim$ where $(t,0) \sim (t,1)$ for all $t\neq 0$. $X$ is not Hausdorff, but $X$ admits an atlas by two charts.

Apparently this pathology can occur in the theory of foliations or taking quotients by non-compact group actions, which is annoying.

>[!example] Long Line
>Let $S_\Omega$ be the smallest uncountable totally ordered set, and let $X = S_\Omega \times (0, 1]$ with dictionary order topology. Then $X$ is not second-countable. This admits a (large) atlas.

>[!example]
>When $\RR$ is endowed with charts $x$ and $x^3$, the identity map is smooth in one direction but not the other.

The same space can have non-diffeomorphic charts, a la John Milnor.
