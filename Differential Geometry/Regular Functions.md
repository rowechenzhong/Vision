A ==**regular function**== on an open set $V\subset X$ in a ($C^k$/RA) manifold $X$ is a function $f:V\to \RR$ such that
$$
	f\circ \phi_\alpha^{-1}: \phi_\alpha(V\cap U_\alpha)\to \RR
$$
has the corresponding regularity class. Ditto for CA manifolds.

This is exactly what you would expect; the way we define any sort of property on manifolds axiomatically is by staring at local homeomorphisms to charts.

The space of all regular functions on $V$ will be denoted by $O(V)$. This is an algebra;
1. It is a vector space obviously.
2. It is an algebra under multiplication (this is important so we can e.g. state the Leibniz Rule).
