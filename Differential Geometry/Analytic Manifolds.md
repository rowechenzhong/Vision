Atlases inherit the adjectives [[regularity class]], [[smooth]], and [[analytic|(complex/real) analytic]] from their [[Atlas#Transition maps|Transition maps]]; e.g. an atlas of class $C^k$ must have $k$-times-continuously-differentiable transition maps.

Insert any adjective in place of $C^k$ in the below discussion.

Two $C^k$ atlases $\{U_\alpha\}$, $\{V_\beta\}$ are said to be ==**$C^k$-compatible**== if the transition maps between $U_\alpha$ and $V_\beta$ are all $C^k$. 

This is an equivalence relation of atlases, and particular equivalence classes are called **==$C^k$-structures==**. Sometimes we will single out a specific structure on a manifold, and use that structure exclusively; in this case, we call the manifold a ==**$C^k$-manifold**==. A ==**diffeomorphism**== or ==**isomorphism**== on such manifolds endowed with structure must respect $C^k$; for any pair of atlases the map $U_\alpha^{-1}\circ \phi \circ V_{\beta}$ must be $C^k$.
