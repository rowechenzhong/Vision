$X$ is ==**locally homeomorphic**== to $Y$ if for every $x\in X$, there exists a neighborhood $U\subset X$ of $x$ and a continuous map $\phi: U\to Y$ such that $\phi: U\to \phi(U)$ is a homeomorphism and $\phi(U)\subset Y$ is open.

In the context of manifolds, one usually uses this when $Y = \RR^n$, and such a map is called a ==**local chart**==.

Pick $P\in X$ with local chart $(U,\phi)$ containing $P\in U$ and centered at $\phi(P) = 0$. Such a chart is called a ==**coordinate chart**== around $P$; it's centered at $P$; this yields ==**local coordinates**== $x_1,\cdots, x_n: U\to \RR$, which describe the coordinates of the manifold.
