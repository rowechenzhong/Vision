>[!definition] Manifold
>An ==**$n$-dimensional topological manifold**== $X$ is:
>1. Hausdorff and has countable base.
>2. is [[locally homeomorphic]] to $\RR^n$.

If $X = \emptyset$, we declare $X$ to be of any integer dimension; else the dimension is uniquely specified.

>[!idea] Complex manifolds
>$\CC\cong \RR^2$ topologically, so if $n = 2m$ is even such a manifold can be thought of as a complex manifold, with local charts pointing into $\CC^m$.

>[!example] Trivial
>$X = \RR^n$ is a manifold of dimension $n$; in general an open subset of an $n$-manifold is an $n$-manifold.

>[!example] Concrete
>$S^n\subset \RR^{n+1}$ is a $n$-manifold (stereographic projection), even though it is not *globally* homeomorphic to any open subset of $\RR^n$.
>
>An $\infty$-sign is not a manifold, because the intersection point is not locally homeomorphic to $\RR$.

See [[Manifold Pathologies]] for non-examples, or the reasons the axioms are important.

>[!idea]
> Being a manifold of a certain dimension is clearly a **local** property. Also, Hausdorffness and second countability are sanity checks which are inherited by subspaces, so in nearly all cases we only care about local homemorphism.
