# Logograms

**Logograms** are symbols used in writing systems to represent entire words or morphemes (units of meaning) rather than individual sounds. 
Each logogram corresponds to a specific word or meaningful part of a word, without directly indicating its pronunciation.

**Example**: Chinese characters are logograms; each character represents a concept or word, like the character æœ¨, which means "tree."
