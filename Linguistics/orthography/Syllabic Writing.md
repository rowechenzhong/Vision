# Syllabic Writing

**Syllabic writing** refers to a writing system where each symbol stands for a syllable rather than an individual sound or whole word. 
This system is particularly useful for languages with simple syllable structures, allowing for easy combination of symbols to form words.

**Example**: Cherokee uses a syllabary, where each symbol represents a syllable, such as Ꮳ (tsa) or Ꮩ (do).
