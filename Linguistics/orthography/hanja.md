# Hanja

**Hanja** refers to the use of traditional Chinese characters in Korean. Historically, hanja was used in Korean writing before Hangul was developed, 
and while it is no longer commonly used in modern writing, it remains present in certain contexts, like scholarly works and historical texts. 
Each hanja character represents a word or concept, similar to its usage in Chinese.

**Example**: The character æ„› (ai), meaning "love," used in both Chinese and Korean.
