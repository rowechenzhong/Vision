# Alphabetic Writing

**Alphabetic writing** is a type of writing system in which symbols (letters) represent individual sounds, specifically phonemes, of a language. 
Each letter typically corresponds to a specific consonant or vowel sound. 
Examples of alphabetic writing systems include the Latin alphabet (used in English), the Cyrillic alphabet, and the Greek alphabet. 
Alphabetic systems are efficient for representing a wide range of phonetic sounds and enable users to phonetically "sound out" unfamiliar words.

**Example**: The English alphabet, with each letter representing a phoneme, allowing for combinations to form words.
