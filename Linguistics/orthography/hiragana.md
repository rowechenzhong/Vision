# Hiragana

**Hiragana** is a syllabary used in Japanese for native words and grammatical functions. Each symbol in hiragana represents a syllable, 
and it is used alongside kanji and katakana in Japanese writing. Hiragana is typically used for native Japanese words, grammar particles, and verb endings.

**Example**: The word さくら (sakura), meaning "cherry blossom," is written entirely in hiragana.
