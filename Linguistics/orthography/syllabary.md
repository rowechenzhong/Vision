# Syllabary

A **syllabary** is a type of phonographic writing system in which each symbol represents a syllable (a combination of consonants and vowels) rather than an individual sound (phoneme) or word. 
Syllabaries are especially suited for languages with simple syllable structures.

**Example**: Japanese kana (hiragana and katakana) are syllabaries, where each symbol corresponds to a distinct syllable, such as か (ka) or に (ni).
