# Abjads

**Abjads** are a type of phonographic writing system where each symbol primarily represents a consonant, while vowels are either optional or inferred from context. 
This system is typical in Semitic languages, like Arabic and Hebrew, where the root structure is based on consonants, and vowels can vary.

**Example**: The Arabic script, where letters represent consonants, and diacritical marks are used sparingly to indicate vowel sounds.
