# Radical

In Chinese characters, a **radical** is a part of the character that typically provides a clue to its meaning. 
Radicals are a key component of character structure, often indicating a general category or context, and are used in dictionaries to organize characters.

**Example**: The character 河 (hé, river) has the water radical 氵 on the left, indicating an association with water.
