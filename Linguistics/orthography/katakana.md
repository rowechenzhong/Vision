# Katakana

**Katakana** is a syllabary used in Japanese, primarily for foreign loanwords, names, and onomatopoeic expressions. Each katakana symbol represents a syllable, 
and it is used alongside kanji and hiragana. Katakana has a more angular appearance compared to hiragana.

**Example**: The word コーヒー (kōhī), meaning "coffee," is written in katakana.
