# Determinatives

**Determinatives** are symbols in logographic writing systems that clarify meaning but are not pronounced. 
They help disambiguate words with similar pronunciations or provide context for understanding the intended meaning of a symbol.

**Example**: In Egyptian hieroglyphs, determinatives indicate categories, like a sitting person to signify a word related to humans.
