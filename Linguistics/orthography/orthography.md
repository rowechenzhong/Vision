# Orthography

**Orthography** is the standardized system of spelling, punctuation, and grammar used within a specific language. 
Orthography encompasses the set of rules for correctly writing words and constructing written language in a way that adheres to cultural or linguistic norms.

**Example**: English orthography includes spelling rules (e.g., adding -es for plurals in some words), punctuation standards, and conventions on capitalization.
