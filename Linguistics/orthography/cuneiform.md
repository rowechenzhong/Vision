# Cuneiform

**Cuneiform** is one of the earliest known systems of writing, developed by the Sumerians around 3400 BCE. 
It consists of wedge-shaped marks made on clay tablets using a reed stylus. 
Originally pictographic, it evolved into a complex system combining logographic and syllabic elements.

**Example**: The Sumerian and Akkadian languages used cuneiform, with symbols representing whole words or syllables.
