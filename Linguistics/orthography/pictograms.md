# Pictograms

**Pictograms** are symbols that visually represent objects or concepts through images. 
They are one of the earliest forms of written communication, where each pictogram corresponds to a specific idea or item.

**Example**: Early cave paintings and petroglyphs are forms of pictograms, visually depicting animals, tools, or other important elements.
