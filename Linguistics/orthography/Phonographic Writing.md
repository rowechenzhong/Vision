# Phonographic Writing

**Phonographic writing** refers to a writing system in which symbols represent sounds rather than meanings or whole words. 
These sounds can be individual phonemes or larger syllabic units. 
Phonographic systems are designed to represent pronunciation, allowing readers to sound out words. 
Types of phonographic systems include alphabets, syllabaries, and abjads.

**Example**: The Latin alphabet, where each letter corresponds to a phoneme, or the Japanese kana system, which represents syllables.
