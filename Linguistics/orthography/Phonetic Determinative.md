# Phonetic Determinative

A **phonetic determinative** is a component of a character that provides a clue to its pronunciation. 
In Chinese and Japanese kanji, many characters are composed of a radical (indicating meaning) and a phonetic component that hints at pronunciation.

**Example**: In the character 河 (hé), meaning "river," the right part 可 (kě) suggests the pronunciation.
