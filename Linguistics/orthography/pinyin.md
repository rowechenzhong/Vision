# Pinyin

**Pinyin** is the romanization system for transcribing the sounds of Mandarin Chinese into the Latin alphabet. 
Developed in the 20th century, pinyin is widely used for teaching pronunciation, with each letter or letter combination representing a particular sound in Mandarin.

**Example**: The character 学 (study) is written as "xué" in pinyin.
