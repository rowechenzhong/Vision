# Boustrophedon

**Boustrophedon** is a style of writing where lines are written alternately from right to left and left to right, similar to the way an ox plows a field. 
This style was common in some ancient scripts and helps minimize the need for returning to the starting edge of the text.

**Example**: Early Greek inscriptions sometimes used boustrophedon, alternating direction with each line.
