# Kanji

**Kanji** are logographic characters in Japanese, adapted from Chinese characters. Each kanji represents a concept, idea, or word, 
and many kanji have multiple pronunciations depending on context. Kanji are used extensively in Japanese, alongside hiragana and katakana.

**Example**: The kanji å±± (yama), meaning "mountain."
