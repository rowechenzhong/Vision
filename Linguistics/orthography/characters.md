# Characters (Chinese)

In the context of Chinese, **characters** are logograms, each representing a word or morpheme with both meaning and often a phonetic component. 
Chinese characters are composed of strokes and structured around radicals that indicate meaning, alongside phonetic components that hint at pronunciation. 
Chinese writing does not have an alphabet but relies on these individual characters, which must be memorized.

**Example**: The character 学 (xué), meaning "to study" or "learn."
