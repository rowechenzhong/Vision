# Abugidas

**Abugidas** are a type of phonographic writing system where each symbol represents a consonant-vowel combination. 
The base symbol typically represents a consonant, with a default vowel sound, and marks or alterations modify the vowel sound. 
This system is used in languages where syllable structure is straightforward.

**Example**: The Devanagari script (used in Hindi), where consonant characters are altered with diacritics to indicate different vowels.
