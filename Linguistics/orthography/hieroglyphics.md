**Hieroglyphics** is the formal writing system used in ancient Egypt, composed of logographic, syllabic, and alphabetic elements. 
Hieroglyphs were often engraved in stone and used for religious and monumental inscriptions, combining symbols for both sounds and meanings.

**Example**: Egyptian hieroglyphs include pictorial symbols for objects and abstract ideas, as well as phonetic characters.
