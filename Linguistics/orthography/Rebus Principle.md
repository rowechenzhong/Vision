# Rebus Principle

The **rebus principle** is a method in writing where symbols or characters represent sounds instead of meanings, often using homophones or similar-sounding words. 
It allows a symbol to represent a sound that is part of another word, facilitating phonetic spelling.

**Example**: In ancient Egyptian, a bee symbol could be used to represent the sound for "bee" and a similar-sounding word, regardless of meaning.
