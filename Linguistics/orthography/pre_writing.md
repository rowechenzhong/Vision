# Pre-Writing

**Pre-writing** refers to symbolic and representational systems that predate formal writing. 
These early marks and symbols may convey meaning but do not systematically represent spoken language.

**Example**: Tally marks used by prehistoric societies to count items, or abstract symbols found on pottery and artifacts.
