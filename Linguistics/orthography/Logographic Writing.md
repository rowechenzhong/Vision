# Logographic Writing

**Logographic writing** is a system in which each symbol represents a word or morpheme (the smallest unit of meaning) rather than sounds. 
In a logographic system, symbols convey meaning directly, often without indicating pronunciation, requiring users to memorize many unique symbols.

**Example**: Chinese writing, where characters represent concepts or words, like æ°´ for "water."
