# Acrophonic Principle

The **acrophonic principle** is a method used in early writing systems where the symbol for a word or sound is represented by the first sound of that word. 
It was a foundational technique for creating alphabets, especially in ancient scripts.

**Example**: In the ancient Phoenician alphabet, the letter *aleph* was originally a pictogram for an ox, representing the /a/ sound.
