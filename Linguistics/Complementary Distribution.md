It is hard to give proofs over $\forall$ quantifiers. Here's how you might try to argue one in linguistics, to show that two sounds are allophones.

>[!idea]
>Another way to say that X and Y are allphones is to say that X and Y have ==**non-contrastive differences**==.

>[!definition] Environment, Complementary Distribution
>An ==**environment**== is a general position within a word.
>
>Two sounds which occur in disjoint environments are in ==**complementary distribution**==.

>[!example] /n/ in English
>1.  \[nÌª\] occurs at the end of words immediately preceding words beginning with a dental consonant. 
>2. \[n\] occurs elsewhere.
