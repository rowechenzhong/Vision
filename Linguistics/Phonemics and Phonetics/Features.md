# Major Class Features
1. \[$\pm$consonantal\]  Consonantal sounds are produced with a major obstruction in the vocal tract. All consonants except glides, \[h\] and \[ʔ\] (produced in the glottis) are consonantal.
2. \[$\pm$sonorant\] Sounds are partitioned in ==**sonorants**== and ==**obstruents**==. Sonorants include vowels, glides, liquids, and nasals.
3. \[$\pm$syllabic\] Capable of acting as syllabic nuclei.

# Manner Features
1. \[$\pm$ nasal\]
2. \[$\pm$ continuant\]
3. \[$\pm$ lateral\]
4. \[$\pm$ delayed release (DR)\] For our purposes, this only involves affricates \[tʃ\] and \[dʒ\].

# Laryngeal Features
1. \[$\pm$voice\]
2. \[$\pm$constricted glottis (CG)\] In English, this is only the glottal stop \[ʔ\]
3. \[$\pm$spread glottis (SG)\] This contains all aspirated consonants and [h].

# Place of Articulation Features
Each non-binary place feature can be further bifurcated .

1. [LABIAL], includes bilabial and labiodental.
	1. [$\pm$round]
2. [CORONAL], includes interdental, alveolar, and alveopalatal sounds.
	1. [$\pm$anterior] includes interdentals and alveolars.
	2. [$\pm$strident] plus strident means alveopalatal or alveolar fricatives/affricates; otherwise [θ] and [ð] are -strident.
3. [DORSAL] are vowels plus palatal and velar consonants.
	1. Binaries: high, low, back, tense.
	2. [$\pm$reduced] applies only to [ə].
