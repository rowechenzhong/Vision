==**Speech sounds**== are ==**phones**==. 
- ==**Articulatory Phonetics**== analyzes the physiological mechanisms of speech production.
- ==**Acoustic Phonetics**== measures and analyzes the physical properties of sound waves produced by speech.

==**IPA**== is a system to represent words. They are enclosed in square brackets.

A segment is a phone. ==**Broad**== transcriptions use simple sets of symbols to represent coarse-grained sounds. If we want to show more detail, we use more complex symbols plus diacritics, yielding a ==**narrow**== transcription.

# Sound-producing System

==**Larynx**== is the sound source containing muscles called ==**vocal folds (vocal cords)**==. Then, filters: ==**Pharynx**== in the throat, ==**oral cavity**==, ==**nasal cavity**==.

I need to memorize this picture:
![[Pasted image 20241003110829.png]]

The ==**Trachea**== and ==**Esophagus**== are sort of well-known; they're the air tube and food tube. The important thing being that the lungs are in front of the stomach, so the trachea is in front of the esophagus. The ==**Glottis**== sits right on top of the trachea.

There are now 5 parts of the tongue that I need to remember apparently. The ==**Tip**== is trivial and the ==**root**== is trivial. Then I just need to remember that the "body" of the tongue is split into the ==**blade**==, ==**body**==, and ==**back**==. The blade is just the part that protrudes, while the body and back are "in the meat of the tongue" collectively the ==**dorsum**==.

You know where the lips and teeth are; you just need to remember they correspond to ==**Labials**== and ==**Dentals**==. I've heard the substring "==**Alveolar ridge**==" enough times to know where it is. I've also heard the substring "==**Alveopalatal**==" enough times to know that the ==**Palate**== goes afterwards.

Then, the order goes ==**Velum**==, ==**Uvula**==, and ==**Pharynx**==.

Lungs contain important muscles ==**diaphragm**== (out) and ==**intercostals**== (in). 

The ==**glottis**== is space between vocal folds.
- "ffff" "ssss" are voiceless. Glottis pulled apart.
- "zzzzz" "vvv" are voiced. Glottis close together but not tightly.
- whispering means the front portions are together while the back portions are apart.
- murmur / breathy means that you can voice sounds but they're still open so air goes through for breathiness.

# Sound Classes

### Vowels vs Consonants

Consonants can be voiced or voiceless (\[v\] vs \[f\]). They're distinguished because they are made when the vocal tract constricts. Vowels are more ==**sonorous**==.

A ==**Syllable**== is a peak of sonority surrounded by less sonorous segments, hence usually we're just counting vowels. The peak of sonority is called the ==**nucleus**== of syllable. 

==**Glides**== are vowels which are produced by moving between two vowel-sounds without constriction, e.g. the y and w in "you" and "wet."

### Places of Articulation

In addition to the common places of articulation discussed earlier, there are also pharyngeal and glottal articulations, which involve constrictions in the lower parts of the vocal tract:

1. **Pharyngeal**: These sounds are produced by constricting the pharynx, which is the part of the throat situated behind the tongue and above the larynx. Pharyngeal sounds are relatively rare in many languages. An example is the voiceless pharyngeal fricative [ħ] found in Arabic, as in the word "ḥaqq" (meaning 'right' or 'truth').

2. **Glottal**: Sounds produced at the glottis, which is the space between the vocal cords.
   - **Glottal stop** [ʔ]: Often heard in English in the interruption of sound, like the catch in the middle of "uh-oh."
   - **Glottal fricative** [h]: As in the English "hat."

### Revised Summary of Places of Articulation with Examples:

**1. Labial (Lips)**
   - *Bilabial*: [p] (pat), [b] (bat), [m] (mouth)
   - *Labiodental*: [f] (fine), [v] (vine)

**2. Dental/Interdental (Teeth)**
   - *Dental*: These don't show up in English much
   - *Interdental*: [θ] (thin, thing), [ð] (then, this)

**3. Alveolar (Alveolar Ridge)**
   - Examples: [t] (top), [d] (dog), [s] (sap), [n] (nap), [l] (lip), [z] (zip)

**4. Post-Alveolar (Just behind the Alveolar Ridge)**
   - Examples: [ʃ] (shin), [ʒ] (measure), (chip), ("dg" in judge)

**5. Palatal (Palate)**
   - Examples: [j] (yes), [ʎ] (like in Italian "famiglia")

**6. Velar (Soft Palate)**
   - Examples: [k] (cat, call), [g] (go, guy), [ŋ] ("ng" in hang, sing)
   - ("w" in wet) is a Labiovelar, primary velar secondary labial, because the tongue body is raised near the velum and the lips are rounded at the same time.

**7. Uvular (Uvula)**
   - Examples: [ʁ] (French "rue"), [χ] (German "Bach")

**8. Pharyngeal (Pharynx)**
   - Examples: [ħ] (Arabic "ḥaqq")

**9. Glottal (Glottis)**
   - Examples: [ʔ] (the catch in "uh-oh"), [h] (hat)

# Manners of Articulation

### Oral versus Nasal Phones
Oral sounds are caused by raising the velum to cut off airflow through the nasal cavity.
