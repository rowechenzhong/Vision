# Simple Vowels and Diphthongs

==**Simple**== vowels don't change during their articulation; pit, set, cat, dog, but, put, and the first vowel of suppose are examples.

==**Diphthongs**== do.
- In ==**major**== diphthongs, this change is very extreme: buy, boy, and now are examples. If you don't notice the change, it's because your brain is short-circuiting the hearing process; note that in "buy" for instance your mouth starts in the "buh" position and ends in the "eye" position, and in "now" your mouth starts in the "nuh" position and ends in the "ow" position.
- In ==**minor**== dipthongs, this is less dramatic, such as "play" (from "uh" to "ayy") and "go" (from "uh" to "oh").

Here’s a list of the simple vowels and diphthongs of American English, along with their corresponding IPA symbols and examples:

### Simple Vowels (Monophthongs)

| Vowel Sound                     | IPA Symbol                       | Example Word | Example Pronunciation |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| Close front unrounded           | /i/                              | see          | /si/                  |
| Near-close near-front unrounded | /ɪ/                              | sit          | /sɪt/                 |
| *Close-mid front unrounded*     | */e/ or /eɪ/ (in some dialects)* | *face*       | */feɪs/*              |
| Open-mid front unrounded        | /ɛ/                              | bed          | /bɛd/                 |
| Near-open front unrounded       | /æ/                              | cat          | /kæt/                 |
| Mid-central                     | /ə/ (schwa)                      | Canada       | /kænədə/              |
| Open-mid back unrounded         | /ʌ/                              | cup          | /kʌp/                 |
| Open-mid back rounded           | /ɔ/                              | thought      | /θɔt/                 |
| Open back unrounded             | /ɑ/                              | pot          | /pɑt/                 |
| Close back rounded              | /u/                              | goose        | /ɡus/                 |
| Near-close near-back rounded    | /ʊ/                              | foot         | /fʊt/                 |

In 24.900, we do not transcribe "face" as /feɪs/, we use /fejs/ instead. There's no /eɪ/ in 24.900, only /ej/.

### Diphthongs

| Diphthong                                                   | IPA Symbol         | Example Word | Example Pronunciation |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------ | --------------------- |
| Close front unrounded to near-close ne%%  %%ar-back rounded | /aɪ/ (24.900 /aj/) | ride         | /raɪd /               |
| Open back unrounded to close front unrounded                | /aʊ/ (24.900 /aw/) | now          | /naʊ/                 |
| Close-mid front unrounded to close front unrounded          | /eɪ/ (24.900 /ej/) | say          | /seɪ/                 |
| Open-mid back rounded to near-close near-front unrounded    | /ɔɪ/ (24.900 /ɔj/) | boy          | /bɔɪ/                 |
| Close back rounded to close front unrounded                 | /oʊ/ (24.900 /ow/) | go           | /ɡoʊ/                 |

In 24.900, we transcribe dipthongs as vowel-glide sequences (the first vowel sound is called the *nucleus*).

# Describing Vowels

You'll noticed that we made a bunch of descriptors under the simple vowels. The basic parameters are:
1. The tongue can be ==**low /mid /high**== and ==**front / central / back**==.
2. The vowel can be ==**tense**== which means it is produced with greater vocal tract constriction, verses ==**lax**==.

When considering a dipthong, we describe it with the nucleus (the above chart contains more detail than expected).

Here is the relevant chart:

You'll notice that /ə/ and /ʌ/ are very very close. One /ʌ/ "cut" and one /ə/ is the "na" in "Canada."
