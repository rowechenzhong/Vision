Human languages don't actually exploit all the possibilities in [[Phonetics]]. The study of the subset a particular language uses is called ==**phonology**==.

There are three levels to phonology.
- Individual speech sounds are ==**segments**==.
- At a higher level, the organization of ==**syllables**==.
- At a lower level, the articulatory and acoustic building blocks of sounds called ==**features**==.

>[!idea] Priors
> Much of this study is about obtaining the correct priors on what is usually legal and what is not, so that you can obtain the distribution of a language in the minimal number of updates. These will be marked in boxes like this.
> 
> Examples should also update your priors.
