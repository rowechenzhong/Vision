In English, certain consonants can function as the nucleus of a syllable, replacing a vowel. These consonants are called ==**syllabic consonants**==. The most common syllabic variants occur with nasals and liquids. They typically appear in unstressed syllables, often after a preceding consonant, especially stops or fricatives.

#### 1. Syllabic Nasals
- **/n̩/** (syllabic "n"): Common in words like **"button"** (/ˈbʌt̩n̩/) and **"kitten"** (/ˈkɪt̩n̩/), where the /n/ takes the role of a vowel, forming its own syllable.
- **/m̩/** (syllabic "m"): Less frequent, seen in words like **"rhythm"** (/ˈrɪðm̩/), where the /m/ carries the syllable without an intervening vowel.
See [[Syllabic Nasals]].
#### 2. Syllabic Liquids
- **/l̩/** (syllabic "l"): Found in words like **"bottle"** (/ˈbɑt̩l̩/) and **"little"** (/ˈlɪt̩l̩/), where the /l/ forms its own syllable, especially in unstressed positions.
- **/ɹ̩/** or **/r̩/** (syllabic "r"): Seen in words like **"butter"** (/ˈbʌt̩ɹ̩/) and **"mother"** (/ˈmʌð̩ɹ̩/), where the /ɹ/ takes on the vowel’s role and becomes syllabic.

These contribute to the fluidity and compactness of English speech.
