As in [[Complementary Distribution]], sometimes given knowledge of a single segment, English can completely predict the subsequence segment, such that multiple segments become a single phoneme.

This commonly occurs for glides following mid tense vowels in English:
- \[e\] is always followed by \[j\] as in \[ej\] for "day." Both are nonback and unrounded.
- \[o\] is always followed by \[w\] as in \[ow\] for "dough." Both are back and rounded.

One writes the general rule "a mid tense vowel in English is predictably followed by a glide that has the same backness and roundness."
