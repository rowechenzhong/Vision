A ==**minimal pair**== is a pair of words which differ by exactly one segment in the same position, and differ in meaning. This exhibits an example which demonstrates that two sounds are in fact members of distinct phonemes.

### Near-minimal pair

This is basically suspicious so I won't talk about it. There is a distribution sense in which sufficiently many words which differ by very few pair of sounds is taken as evidence that those pairs of sounds are contrastive.

>I think all of this stuff is distributional for real; we have priors on the likelihood of a distinction to be contrastive based off the perceived similarity of their sounds.
