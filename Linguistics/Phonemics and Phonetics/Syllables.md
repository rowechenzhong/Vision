A basic syllable looks like this:

>[!idea] Priors
>Generally the ==**syllabic nucleus**== must be a vowel or diphthong of some sort, but in English we also allow sonorant consonants.
>
>The onset is almost always allowed, and is usually more permissive than the coda. Syllables in English can have up to three consonants at the beginning of syllables, and up to four consonants afterwards.
>
>When the coda has constraints such as "no voiced obstruents" (German), this leads to a common phenomenon called ==**devoicing**== (of word-final voiced obstruents).

>[!idea]
>==**Phonotactics**== is used for the branch of phonology about permissible combinations of phonemes.

Syllables with a coda are called ==**closed**== (resp. ==**open**==).

Notably, the onset takes precedence to the coda (as its rules are more restrictive, this makes some sense).
