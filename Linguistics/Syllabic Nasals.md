In American English, nasals such as /m/ and /n/ can sometimes serve as the nucleus of a syllable, much like a vowel. When this happens, these nasals are called [[syllabic]] consonants. Syllabic nasals are typically marked in IPA with a small vertical line underneath the consonant symbol: /m̩/ and /n̩/.

#### General Characteristics:
- **Syllabic nasals** occur when there is no vowel in the syllable, and the nasal takes on the role of a vowel, carrying the syllable’s “weight.”
- This often happens in unstressed syllables, especially after a preceding consonant, particularly after stops or fricatives.

### Syllabic /m/ (IPA: /m̩/)
The syllabic /m̩/ occurs less frequently than /n̩/, but it can be heard in casual speech, particularly in words ending with **-sm** or **-zm** clusters.

**Examples:**
- **rhythm**: /ˈrɪðm̩/
- **prism**: /ˈprɪzm̩/

In these cases, the final "m" is pronounced without a distinct vowel sound between the final consonants.

### Syllabic /n/ (IPA: /n̩/)
The syllabic /n̩/ is much more common and is often found in words with **-ten** or **-den** endings, or where a nasal follows a stop or fricative.

**Examples:**
- **button**: /ˈbʌt̩n̩/
- **kitten**: /ˈkɪt̩n̩/
- **hidden**: /ˈhɪd̩n̩/
- **lesson**: /ˈlɛs̩n̩/

In these cases, the /n/ takes on the role of the vowel, and the syllable ends with a nasal sound without an intervening vowel.

### Phonetic Context:
- Syllabic nasals often occur in **unstressed syllables**.
- They usually follow a consonant (especially **stops** like /t/ or /d/ or **fricatives** like /s/), and the vowel that would normally be present in the syllable is reduced or deleted.
- In some dialects, these syllabic nasals might be pronounced with a schwa before the nasal (e.g., "button" as /ˈbʌtən/), but in many American English dialects, the nasal takes over the syllable entirely.
