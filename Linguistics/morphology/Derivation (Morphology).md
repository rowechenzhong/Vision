==**Derivational affixes**== change the meaning and sometimes the part of speech of a word. There are broadly two types:
- ==**Class 1 affixes**== often change the pronunciation of the base, i.e. "sane" -> "sanity"
- ==**Class 2 affixes**== are phonologically conditioned, i.e. "sane" -> "sanely"

There is a special rule, which is that class $2$ suffixes cannot precede a class $1$ suffix; "fear-less-ly" is a word, but "fear-less-ize" is not.
