English has inflectional suffixes which modify the meaning of a word:

| Category  | Inflectional Suffix                | Example            |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Noun      | -s (plural)                        | book -> books      |
|           | -'s (possession)                   | John's book        |
| Verb      | -ed (past tense)                   | arrive -> arrived  |
|           | -ing (progressive)                 | arrive -> arriving |
|           | -s (third person singular present) | arrive -> arrives  |
| Adjective | -er (comparative)                  | big -> bigger      |
|           | -est (superlative)                 | big -> biggest     |

English is not a highly inflected language; many languages have a much larger number of inflectional suffixes.
