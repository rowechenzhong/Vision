The core distinction between inflectional and derivational affixes is that inflectional affixes are generically more ==**semantically transparent**== than derivational affixes.
This means that the meaning of a word produced by an inflectional suffix can be easily deduced from the root and the inflectional suffix. Conversely, the meaning of a word produced by a derivational suffix is not easily deducible from the root and the derivational suffix.

>[!example] "actor" vs "professor"
> An "actor" is someone who acts, but a "professor" is not someone who professes.

Another perspective on the same idea: inflection does not change either the syntactic category or the *type of meaning* of the word.

>[!example] "kingdom"
> "king" is a person while "kingdom" is a place, hence "-dom" is a derivational suffix.

As a corollary, derivational affixes combine with the base before inflectional affixes. Hence, "neighborhoods" implies that it cannot be possible that "-hood" is an inflectional suffix and "-s" is a derivational suffix (in fact, it is the opposite).

Due to this semantic transparency, inflectional affixes are generically more ==**productive**== than derivational affixes; they can be combined with a larger number of bases than derivational affixes. For example, the derivational suffix "-ment" combines with verbs to form a noun meaning "the state of being acted upon by that verb"; "confinement" is a noun meaning "the state of being confined". However, some words do not act on anything, e.g. "to run"; hence "runment" cannot be a valid word. You can see that because "-ment" changes the syntactic category of a word, it is required to assume things about the verb it combines with, and hence cannot be maximally productive.

> The derivational suffix "-ment" combines with transitive verbs (only) to form a noun representing the state of the direct object being acted upon.
