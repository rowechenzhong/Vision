Combining "fire" and "truck" to form "firetruck" is an example of compounding. English orthography is not consistent in its usage of single words, hyphens, or multiple words to represent compounds.

Compounds can be ==**semantically endocentric**== meaning that the meaning of the compound is derived from the meaning of the head (rightmost word, in English and nearly all other languages), or ==**semantically exocentric**== meaning that the meaning of the compound cannot be predicted from the meanings of the constituent words.
