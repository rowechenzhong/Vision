An ==**obstruent**== is a stop, fricative, or affricate. This categorization is relevant for Phonology.
### Stop Consonants

These stop airflow in either the oral cavity or the glottis. They're like "normal consonants" with a very pronounced recognizable sound.

|                     | Bilabial | Alveolar | Velar | Glottal |
| ------------------- | -------- | -------- | ----- | ------- |
| Non-nasal Voiceless | [p]      | [t]      | [k]   | [ʔ]     |
| Non-nasal Voiced    | [b]      | [d]      | [g]   |         |
| Nasal Voiced        | [m]      | [n]      | [ŋ]   |         |

More about [ŋ] -- it terminates the "ng" in "-ing," but it also shows up *with a g sound afterwards* in "finger" (but not "singer!"). The important thing is that this is a *stop*. This also shows up in "blank" and "and" and "ink," where it also makes a stop; the distinction against "blane" or "an" is that we try to stop this sound really fast, which happens at the velum instead of the alveolar ridge.

See [[Aspirated Stop Consonants]], [[Syllabic Nasals]], and [[flaps]].


### Fricatives
==**Continuants**== are produced with a continuous airflow through the mouth.

==**Fricatives**== $\subset$ Continuants, and are distinguished because the air passes through a very narrow opening, yielding an audible noise.

|           | Labiodental | Interdental       | Alveolar | Alveopalatal  | Glottal |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------------- | -------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Voiceless | [f]         | [θ] (thin, thing) | [s]      | [ʃ] (ship)    | [h]     |
| Voiced    | [v]         | [ð] (then, this)  | [z]      | [ʒ] (measure) |         |


### Affricates

This is best explained by pronouncing "chip," then holding the "chhhhhh" sound. Observe that at the beginning of the "ch," your tongue moves to the alveolar ridge just like in [t], but then withdraws and maintains the sound as in [ʃ]. If you had started in "[ʃ]" you would have said "ship," and if you didn't maintain the sound afterwards, you would have said "tip."

So the "ch" sound is denoted [tʃ]. This is the voiceless version.

The voiced version is [d] followed by [ʒ]. There aren't good examples in English so we're going to make up words. Start with "major" and stretch out the "j" (make sure you don't transition to the "errr"). If you didn't make the explosive sound at the beginning of the "j," you would say "maʒ-er" like in "measure" but with "may" at the front. On the other hand, try saying "major" but stop right before you say the "j" and observe where you tongue is. At this point, you can say "made" or "major;" they both begin with your tongue pushed to the top of the alveolar ridge (for that matter, you can also say "mater" or "mayner"). So yeah, this "j" sound is [dʒ].

affricates and fricatives $\subset$ ==**stridents**== (or ==**sibilants**==) because they're louder; the other ones are called ==**nonstrident**==.
