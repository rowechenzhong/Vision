Polish appears to have the following Consonants:

|              | VL Stop | V-d Stop | Nasal | VL Fricative | V-d fricative |
| ------------ | ------- | -------- | ----- | ------------ | ------------- |
| Labial       | p       | b        | m     | f            | v             |
| Dental       |         |          |       |              |               |
| Alveolar     | t       | d        | n     | s            | z             |
| Alveopalatal |         |          |       | [ʃ]          | [ʒ]           |
| Velar        | k       | g        |       |              |               |

|              | VL Affricate | V-Affricate | Approximant |
| ------------ | ------------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| Labial       |              |             |             |
| Dental       |              |             |             |
| Alveolar     |              |             | r (trill)   |
| Alveopalatal | [tʃ]         | [dʒ]        |             |
| Velar        |              |             |             |

This is definitely a subset though.

Here are the Polish vowel sounds

|      | Front | Central | Back |
| ---- | ----- | ------- | ---- |
| High | i     |         | u    |
| Mid  | ɛ     |         | ɔ    |
| Low  | æ     |         |      |

There seem to be very few?


Polish does not distinguish aspirated from unaspirated stops; I simply explained to Tomasz what these distinctions meant, giving examples such as "pat" versus "spat," and Tomasz said that these distinctions were not anything he'd ever considered before. The complementary distribution seems to be something very similar to English, where generally a word-initial voiceless stop is aspirated. For instance /dɔm/ is not aspirated (it's voiced), /tɔm/ is aspirated, and /ˈkura/ is aspirated.

Polish *does* distinguish voiced from voiceless consonants; Tomasz gave the example of /dɔm/ which means house and /tɔm/ which means book, and /ɡura/ which means mountain versus /kura/ which means chicken.

There were lots of mixed examples for the case of word-final devoicing! Tomasz constantly points out that Polish has both "formal" or "textbook" and "informal" methods of communication, which are super important to understanding the language. Tomasz agrees that Polish generically distinguishes voiced from voiceless consonants even at the end of words, especially when written. As a case in point, /smɔk/ means dragon and /smɔg/ means "smog," and these are spelled differently (which would normally indicate differing [k] and [g] sounds). According to "textbook" or "formal" Polish, Tomasz believes that these should be pronounced very similarly, where the [k] in /smok/ is devoiced, such that it is pronounced /smɔg/. But when talking colloquially, it is common to pronounce "dragon" as /smɔk/, and it is sometimes possible to emphasize (as a clarification in case of miscommunication, I think), to emphasize the [g] in /smɔg/ to indicate you are referring to "smog." There definitely exist words which end with a voiced consonant; Tomasz believes that /bænk/ ("bank") is consistently pronounced ending with the [k] sound. Tomasz admits to not having thought about this much, but he does think that devoicing occurs, especially in formal Polish.

Polish does not appear to have nasal assimilation, but we couldn't really figure this one out, because it seems like Polish has a rule that makes it non-canonical to place nasals in front of unvoiced consonants;  people will sometimes insert an extra vowel like /banɛk/ in the word /bank/ ("bank") just to avoid saying those two sounds together, and Tomasz conjectures that /bank/ is a loan word in Polish. Polish has apparently been influenced by a lot of languages though. As some other examples, /stɔnʌkæ/ is supposed to be a type of bug that lives in potatoes, which Tomasz says would be pronounced (if spoken how it was written) as /stɔnkæ/, but people add in the /ʌ/.

Finally, Tomasz believes that \[ʃ] and \[ʒ] should never precede \[i]. We also tried to figure out the stressed syllable rules together. It is generically penultimate stress, but for some word forms such as four /tʃtɛdɛ/ and four-hundred /tʃtɛdɛstæ/, the stress remains where it was on the root word.
