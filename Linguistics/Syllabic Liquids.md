### Syllabic Variants of Liquids

In American English, both /l/ and /ɹ/ can become [[syllabic]], meaning they serve as the nucleus of a syllable (taking the role normally occupied by a vowel), especially in unstressed syllables. Syllabic consonants are marked with a small vertical line beneath the symbol, like /l̩/ and /ɹ̩/.

#### Syllabic /l/ (IPA: /l̩/)
- **Syllabic /l̩/** occurs when the /l/ sound takes on the role of the vowel in a syllable, typically in word-final positions after a consonant.
- **Examples**:
  - **bottle**: /ˈbɑt̩l̩/
  - **little**: /ˈlɪt̩l̩/
  - **apple**: /ˈæp̩l̩/

  In these words, the /l/ becomes the syllabic nucleus, especially in fast or casual speech. The schwa or reduced vowel that might occur between the consonant and /l/ is dropped, and /l/ alone carries the syllable.

#### Syllabic /ɹ/ (IPA: /ɹ̩/ or /r̩/)
- **Syllabic /ɹ̩/** is common in American English, especially in unstressed syllables after consonants like /t/, /d/, and /n/.
- **Examples**:
  - **butter**: /ˈbʌt̩ɹ̩/
  - **mother**: /ˈmʌð̩ɹ̩/
  - **runner**: /ˈɹʌn̩ɹ̩/

  Similar to syllabic /l̩/, the /ɹ/ in these examples acts as the nucleus of the syllable, replacing a vowel that might otherwise be present.

>[!idea]
>There is also the syllabic /ɝ/. This guy is called an "r-colored vowel" version of the schwa. I guess this usually shows up in the middle of words like "bird." It's too deep.

### Phonetic Context of Syllabic Liquids

- **Syllabic liquids** often occur in unstressed syllables, particularly after stops (/t/, /d/, /p/, /b/) or fricatives (/s/, /z/). 
- In these contexts, the schwa vowel between the consonant and the liquid is often omitted, and the liquid sound itself becomes the syllable nucleus.
- In faster, more casual speech, syllabic liquids are even more likely to occur.

### Syllabic Liquids vs. Non-Syllabic Liquids

- In words like **"bottle"** (/ˈbɑt̩l̩/), the /l/ is syllabic and carries the syllable without a vowel sound.
- In contrast, in words like **"leader"** (/ˈlidɚ/), the /ɹ/ is non-syllabic because the /ɚ/ sound functions as a vowel, keeping the liquid as a consonant only.

### Acoustic Properties

- **Syllabic /l̩/**: Marked by a lateral airflow (air passing around the sides of the tongue) and often by a slight vowel-like quality as the syllable’s nucleus.
- **Syllabic /ɹ̩/**: Has a smooth, vowel-like resonance and acts similarly to the American English rhotacized schwa /ɚ/.
