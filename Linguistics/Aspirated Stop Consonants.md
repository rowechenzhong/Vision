In American English, the sounds /p/, /t/, and /k/ are aspirated (followed by a burst of air) when they appear at the beginning of stressed syllables. The aspiration is represented in the IPA with a small superscript "h" (ʰ). Here are examples:

| Consonant | IPA Symbol with Aspiration | Example Word | Example Pronunciation (IPA) |
| --------- | -------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------- |
| /p/       | **pʰ**                     | **p**ot      | **pʰɑt**                    |
| /t/       | **tʰ**                     | **t**op      | **tʰɑp**                    |
| /k/       | **kʰ**                     | **k**it      | **kʰɪt**                    |

- **p** in **s**pot: **/spɑt/** (no aspiration)
- **t** in **s**top: **/stɑp/** (no aspiration)
- **k** in **s**kirt: **/skɝt/** (no aspiration)

In English, aspiration primarily occurs at the beginning of stressed syllables and is absent in consonants that come after "s;" this is because all of the air that would've been used in the burst has been absorbed by the *fricative* s; see [[Consonants#Fricatives]].
