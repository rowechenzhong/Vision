Within a word, usually exactly one syllable is ==**stressed**==. To compute this, languages first define some other things.

> [!definition] Syllable Weight
> Syllables have ==**weight**==, which is determined by their rhyme.
> - In ==**heavy**== syllables, the vowel is followed by another element, such as a glide or consonant. ("bad" / "bye")
> - In ==**light**== syllables, the rhyme contains just a single vowel or syllabic consonant. ("bee")

> [!example] English rules
> 1. If the verb contains one syllable, there are no decisions.
> 2. Else
> 	1. Verbs
> 		1. If the final syllable is heavy, stress falls on the final syllable.
> 		2. Else, it falls on the penultimate syllable.
> 	2. Nouns
> 		1. If there are two syllables, on the penultimate syllable.
> 		2. Else
> 			1. If the penultimate syllable is heavy, it is on the penultimate syllable.
> 			2. Else, it falls on the antepenultimate syllable.

Stressed syllables are marked by placing a diacritic \['\] in front of the syllable, e.g. \[ə.'pʰɔn\] (for "upon").
