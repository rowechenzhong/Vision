# Glides: /j/ and /w/

Glides, also known as **semi-vowels**, are a class of sounds that behave like consonants but have characteristics similar to vowels. They involve a rapid movement (or "glide") of the articulators (tongue and lips) from one position to another, typically from a more closed (consonant-like) position to a more open (vowel-like) position. In English, the two main glides are **/j/** (as in "yet") and **/w/** (as in "witch"). Additionally, some dialects of English distinguish between **/w/** and a voiceless counterpart **/ʍ/** (as in "which").

### /j/: Palatal Glide (as in "yet")

- **Articulation**: The sound /j/ is produced by raising the body of the tongue towards the hard palate (the roof of the mouth), similar to the position for the vowel /i/ (as in "see"). The glide occurs as the tongue moves quickly away from this constriction.
- **Example**: 
  - **yet**: /jɛt/
  - **yes**: /jɛs/
- **Acoustic Properties**: /j/ is voiced, meaning the vocal cords vibrate during its production. It is a quick, smooth sound that transitions rapidly into the following vowel.

### /w/: Labio-Velar Glide (as in "witch")

- **Articulation**: The sound /w/ involves both the lips (labial) and the back of the tongue (velar). The lips are rounded, and the back of the tongue raises towards the velum (soft part of the roof of the mouth, toward the back), similar to the position for the vowel /u/ (as in "too"). The glide happens as the articulators move quickly into the following vowel.
- **Example**: 
  - **witch**: /wɪtʃ/
  - **we**: /wi/
- **Acoustic Properties**: /w/ is also voiced, with a characteristic lip rounding and tongue movement towards the velum. It transitions smoothly into the following vowel.

### /ʍ/: Voiceless Labio-Velar Glide (as in "which")

- **Articulation**: In some dialects, especially older or more conservative varieties of English (like Scottish English or some Southern American dialects), there is a distinction between /w/ and /ʍ/. The glide /ʍ/ is the voiceless counterpart of /w/. It is produced in a similar manner, but without vocal cord vibration, giving it a breathier quality.
- **Example**:
  - **which**: /ʍɪtʃ/
  - **whale**: /ʍeɪl/
- **Acoustic Properties**: The voiceless nature of /ʍ/ makes it sound more like a fricative, though it is still considered a glide due to the rapid tongue and lip movement. This distinction is largely lost in most modern dialects of English, where both "witch" and "which" are pronounced with /w/.

### Key Differences Between Glides and Other Consonants:
1. **Vowel-like Quality**: Glides are similar to vowels because they involve open vocal tracts and smooth, continuous airflow. However, unlike vowels, glides do not form the syllable nucleus and are always followed by a vowel.
2. **Rapid Transition**: Glides occur as a quick transition between a consonant-like position and a following vowel, giving them their "glide" quality.
3. **Syllable Position**: Glides typically occur at the beginning of syllables (before a vowel), making them onset consonants in most cases.
