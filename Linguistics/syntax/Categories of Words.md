A word is ==**lexical**== if it contains meaning, as opposed to ==**nonlexical**== words, which are functional.

Here are the lexical categories:

| Symbol | Lexical Category | Examples                           |
| ------ | ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| N      | Noun             | dog, house, tree, love, freedom    |
| V      | Verb             | run, jump, think, love, hate       |
| A      | Adjective        | big, small, fast, slow, happy      |
| P      | Preposition      | on, in, at, from, by, with         |
| Adv    | Adverb           | quickly, happily, very, too, again |

Here are the nonlexical categories:

| Symbol | Nonlexical Category  | Examples                         |
| ------ | -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Det    | Determiner           | the, a, this, that, some, any    |
| Deg    | Degree               | very, too, extremely, quite      |
| Aux    | Auxiliary (Modal)    | will, would, can, must, should   |
| Aux    | Auxiliary (Nonmodal) | be, have, do                     |
| Conj   | Conjunction          | and, or, but, if, because, while |

In many languages such as English, a single word can belong to multiple categories depending on its function in a sentence.

>[!example] "Comb" can be a Noun or a Verb
>
>"Comb" can be a noun (as in "a comb") or a verb (as in "to comb").

>[!example] "near" can be a preposition, verb, or adjective
>1. Preposition: "near the house"
>2. Verb: "to near"
>3. Adjective: "X is nearer than Y"

How does one determine which category a word belongs to?

### Meaning

This is pretty obvious.
- Nouns generically refer to entities
- Verbs refer to actions
- Adjectives describe attributes
- Adverbs describe attributes of actions

### Inflection

See [[Inflection]].

Hence if an unknown word ends in "-ed", it is probably a verb.

Inflection gives positive information but can miss cases (e.g. "intelligent" does not admit a comparative or superlative form).

### Distribution

Nouns generically occur with determiners, verbs with auxiliaries, adjectives with degree words, etc. The meaning of "occur with" will be discussed later. As examples, the following combinations are ungrammatical:
- \*will destruction (auxiliary + noun)
- \*the destroy (determiner + verb)
- \*very appreciate (degree word + verb)

Hence, if an unknown word occurs with a determiner, it is probably a noun, and almost certainly not a verb.
