>[!definition] Morpheme
>The smallest meaningful unit in the grammar of a language. Morphemes are indivisible without losing or altering their meaning. They can be ==**free morphemes**==, which stand alone as words (like "book"), or ==**bound morphemes**==, which must be attached to other morphemes to convey meaning (like prefixes or suffixes).

Morphemes are the building blocks of words, much like atoms are to molecules in chemistry. Understanding them is crucial for deeper insights into the mechanics of language.

>[!definition] Lexicon
>The complete set of all words in a language, including their forms, meanings, and syntactic properties. The lexicon is akin to a database, not just a dictionary, encompassing all morphological rules and idiosyncrasies of the words it contains.

The lexicon is a fundamental concept that captures the breadth of vocabulary in a language, highlighting the rich interplay between words and their uses.

>[!definition] Merge
>A fundamental syntactic operation in generative grammar that combines two elements (words, phrases, etc.) into a larger structure. This operation is recursive, allowing the hierarchical structure of a sentence to be built up progressively.

Merge is a cornerstone of syntactic structure, serving as a key process by which languages construct coherent and complex sentences from simpler components.

>[!definition] Root, Base, Head
>- ==**Root:**== The core morpheme in a word, carrying the primary semantic content, and indecomposable into smaller parts.
>- ==**Base:**== A form to which affixes are added, which can be a simple root or a compound of several morphemes.
>- ==**Head:**== The morpheme that dictates the syntactic type of the phrase. For instance, in "industrial," the head would be "-al" because it indicates that this word is an adjective.

These terms help linguists describe how words are formed and how they function within larger expressions, clarifying the roles that different components play in the structure of language.

>[!definition] Affixes: Prefix, Suffix, Infix
>- ==**Prefix:**== An affix attached to the beginning of a root or stem, like "un-" in "unhappy".
>- ==**Suffix:**== An affix attached to the end of a root or stem, like "-ness" in "happiness".
>- ==**Infix:**== An affix inserted within a root, common in Austronesian languages but rare in English.

Affixes are tools used by languages to modify meanings and create new words, showcasing the flexibility and creativity inherent in linguistic systems.

>[!definition] Reduplication
>A morphological process where all or part of a word, or a phonological pattern, is repeated. Reduplication can be used to indicate grammatical variations such as tense, mood, plurality, etc., and is a prevalent feature in many languages worldwide.

Reduplication adds a layer of complexity to language, enabling subtle changes in meaning and grammatical function through the simple mechanism of repetition.

>[!definition] Allomorph
>Variants of a morpheme that differ in sound but not in meaning, depending on phonological or morphological context. For example, the plural morpheme "-s" in English has allomorphs [s], [z], and [Éªz], as in "cats," "dogs," and "horses," respectively.

Allomorphs illustrate the nuanced ways in which language operates, adapting to its phonetic environment to maintain fluency and ease of communication.
