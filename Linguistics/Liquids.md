# Liquids

==**Liquids**== are a class of consonants that include /l/ (the **lateral approximant**) and /ɹ/ (the **alveolar approximant**, often written as /r/). These sounds are called liquids because of their fluid, smooth quality in speech. They are articulated with some closure in the vocal tract but not enough to create turbulent airflow, as with fricatives.

#### /l/: Lateral Approximant
- **Articulation**: The tongue touches the alveolar ridge (just behind the upper front teeth) while air flows around the sides of the tongue.
- **Examples**: 
  - **leaf**: /lif/
  - **luck**: /lʌk/

#### /ɹ/: Alveolar Approximant
- **Articulation**: The tongue approaches the alveolar ridge without making full contact, allowing the air to pass through smoothly.
- **Examples**:
  - **reef**: /ɹif/
  - **right**: /ɹaɪt/
