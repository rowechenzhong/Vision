>[!definition] Phoneme
>A ==**phoneme**== is an equivalence class of sounds which produce contrasts in meaning. We denote phonemes with /.../ slashes.

>[!idea] Priors
>Phonemes must be "sufficiently similar;" [h] and [ŋ] exhibit no [[Minimal Pairs]] because [h] almost never appears at the ends of words and [ŋ] almost never appears at the front of words. But they're still different phonemes because they don't sound remotely similar.

>[!example] /n/ in English
>1. We pronounce "one time" as \[wʌn\] which is the usual alveolar sound.
>2. We pronounce "one thing" as \[wʌn̪\], which is dental.
>   
> This distinction is automatic, and does not influence meaning.

>[!definition] Allophones
>==**Allophones**== are distinct sounds which are assigned to the same phoneme, which do not create a contrast in meaning.

Conversely, \[n\] and \[ŋ\] are straight up distinct phonemes. I won't give more examples of distinct phoneme pairs because these are trivial to describe.

>[!example] Vowel lengthening
>English vowels of all types are automatically lengthened in front of voiced obstruents (stops, fricatives, and affricates).

See [[Minimal Pairs]] and [[Complementary Distribution]] to determine equivalence classes.

We write ==**phonemic representations**== of words by using only their phonemic equivalence classes, e.g. "tied" can be /tajd/ instead of [tʰajd].
