# Inspiration

We want to be able to explicitly realize the spin representations of $\so_{2n}$ and $\so_{2n+1}$. This is tricky, because they don't occur in tensor powers of $V$ due to having half-integer spin. In particular these representations do not lift to $\SO(V)$, and instead lift to a ==**spin group**== $\Spin(n)$ which double-covers.

However, the tensor product of a spin representation with its dual, $S\otimes S^*$, has all integer weights, and can be expressed in terms of $V$. Thus, we wish to take $V$ and embed it as a space which looks like $\End S$; this would yield the desired ==**spinors**==.

> [!idea]
> You have seen all of this play out in QM and QFT already, so you know what's coming. As a reminder of the QM picture, a spinor in a representation of $\so_{3}$ was an element of $\CC^2$. $\Spin(3)$ happens to be the same as $\su(2)$; this is a low-dimensional collision; this acts naturally on the space $\End \CC^2$.

# $\so(V) \equiv \wedge^2V \implies \Cl(V)$

$\so(V)\cong \wedge^2 V$ as vector spaces via the "plane of rotation" embedding. We want to extend this to an algebra map from the universal envelope of $\so(V)$ to some "envelope" of $\wedge^2V$, which turns out to be isomorphic as a vector space to $\wedge V$. The induced algebra is called $\Cl(V)$.

> [!proof]- Explain it on a basis
> Give $V$ the naive basis $e_1,\dots e_N$; then $\so(V)$ consists of skew-symmetric matrices spanned by $e_{ij} - e_{ji}$, $i < j$ (no factor of $\frac12$ here; its just a choice). This can be identified in the vector space sense with $e_i\wedge e_j$. The induced lie bracket looks like $$[e_a\wedge e_b, e_c\wedge e_d] = \left( \delta_{bc}e_{ad} - \delta_{ac}e_{bd} - \delta_{bd}e_{ac} + \delta_{ad}e_{bc}\right) - \text{symmetric};$$the basis-free bilinear extension is $$[a\wedge b, c\wedge d] = (b,c)a\wedge d - (a,c)b\wedge d - (b,d)a\wedge c + (a,d)b\wedge c.$$Alright cool. Under the $\Cl(V)$ map we want to send $a\wedge b\to \frac12\left(ab - ba\right)$. One can check by explicit computation that this is a Lie algebra homomorphism if $\{a,b\} = (a,b)$.

>[!proof]- Explain it naturally
>$V$ is endowed with a metric $\eta$. $\so(V)$ consists of elements $\omega^\alpha_\beta$ such that $\omega^{\alpha\beta} + \omega^{\beta\alpha} = 0$. It's obvious what's happening now; the map $\so(V)\to \wedge^2V$ is contraction against $\eta$.

> [!definition] Clifford Algebra
> Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional vector space over algebraically closed $k$ of characteristic $\neq 2$ with a nondegenerate symmetric inner product $(\bullet,\bullet)$. The ==**Clifford Algebra**== $\Cl(V)$ is the algebra generated by $v\in V$ with defining relations $v^2 = \frac12 (v,v)$ for $v\in V$. In particular, $\{a,b\} = (a,b)$.

Thus we have an embedding $\xi:\so(V)\hookrightarrow \Cl(V)$. Here's [[Clifford Algebras intuition]].

> [!idea] The explicit action of $\so(V)$.
> From now on, $a\wedge b$ just means $\frac12(ab - ba)$ on $\Cl(V)$; there's no $\wedge$ operation on $\Cl(V)$, but this is a natural notation (its compatible with the grading later).
> 
> $\so(V)$ acts by $\rho(a\wedge b)(x) = (a\wedge b)x - x(a\wedge b)$. Not deep.

>[!idea]
>You have seen all of this before. The $V$'s inside $\Cl(V)$ are the $\gamma^\mu$ matrices, and under QFT conventions $\{\gamma^\mu, \gamma^\nu\} = 2\eta^{\mu\nu}$. The full algebra is spanned by the ==**Dirac Bilinears**==, of which there are $2^4 = 16$ in $1+3$ dimensions. Then, the generators map (in QFT) as $S^{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{4}[\gamma^\mu, \gamma^\nu]$.

# Alternative for Experts: $\so(V)\curvearrowright V\hookrightarrow \Cl(V)$ is a deformation of $\bigwedge V$

The extension $\so(V)\curvearrowright V\hookrightarrow \bigwedge V$ works in a really stupid way: $0 = \rho(g)\{a,b\} = \{g(a), b\} + \{a,g(b)\} = 0$. Somehow, too many things are killed in this relation. This motivates us to consider the deformation $\{a,b\} = (a,b)$.

It is compatible with the defining relation:
$$0 = \rho(g)(a,b) = \rho(g)\{a,b\} = g(a)b + ag(b) + bg(a) + g(b)a = (a,g(b)) + (b,g(a))$$
It is clear that this is completely equivalent to the original definition: if $x = x_1\dots x_k$, the action of $a\wedge b$ via $[a\wedge b, x]$ can be expanded as$$
\sum x_1\dots \widehat{x_j} [a\wedge b, x_j]\dots x_k
$$and one can check the action of $\so(V)\curvearrowright V$ works. I guess the mantra is **inner representations extend to inner representations on powers.**

> [!proof]- Computation on basis vectors (boring)
> $[e_i\wedge e_j, e_k] = e_ie_je_k - e_je_ie_k - e_ke_ie_j + e_ke_je_i = 2\delta_{jk}e_i - 2\delta_{ik}e_j$ as desired.

In the same way that the [[Universal Enveloping Algebra]] is a [[deformation]] of $S(V)$ (roughly speaking, a valid first-order perturbation to the algebra operator $V^*\otimes V^*\otimes V$), the Clifford algebra is a deformation of $\wedge^n V$. The associated Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt-like theorem states that given an ordered basis of $V$, $\Cl(V)$ has basis given by ordered subsequences of this basis. We will prove this immediately.

# $\Cl(V)$ is the square of $S$

The algebra $\Cl(V)$ is isomorphic to $\Mat_{2^n}(k)$ if $\dim V = 2n$, and $\Mat_{2^n}(k) \oplus \Mat_{2^n}(k)$ if $\dim V = 2n + 1$. This is insanely good, because we just embedded $V$ into $\End M$ like we desired. I think the following construction is important to see to understand the whole picture, so let's be more explicit:

> [!theorem] When $\dim V = 2n$, $\Cl(V)\cong \Mat_{2^n}(k)$
> Pick [[Dn|the usual basis]], and consider the $\Cl(V)$ module $M = \bigwedge(a_1,\dots, a_n)$ with the action of $\Cl(V)$ defined by$$\rho(a_i)w = a_iw,\qquad \rho(b_i)w = \frac{\pa w}{\pa a_i}$$where$$\pa_{a_i} a_{k_1}\dots a_{k_r} = (-1)^{j-1} a_{k_1}\dots\widehat{a_{k_j}}\dots a_{k_r}.$$ Then $\rho:\Cl(V)\to \End M$ is an isomorphism.

> The usual basis now has an additional element $z$. We construct two $\Cl(V)$ modules $M_\pm = \bigwedge(a_1,\dots, a_n)$ with the action of $\Cl(V)$ defined by$$\rho(a_i)w = a_iw,\qquad \rho(b_i)w = \frac{\pa w}{\pa a_i},\qquad zw = \pm\left(-1\right)^w w$$where $\deg w$ is the number of terms in $w$. Then $\rho:\Cl(V)\to \End M_+\oplus \End M_-$ are isomorphisms.

> [!idea] Grassmann Picture and QFT Waffles
> This reminds me of the related Grassmann picture from QFT. $M$ consists of the Grassman algebra generated by $a_i$, and $\Cl(V)$ is exactly the algebra generated by $a_i$ and $\pa_{a_i}$, and $\{a_i, b_j\} = \delta_{ij}$. These $a_i$ and $b_i$ can also be thought of as raising and lowering operators. $M$ shouldn't be thought of as containing objects of the same type as $\Cl(V)$ I think.
>
> I think these objects correspond exactly, but I'm not completely sure. Spinors fields are functions from $\RR^{1+3}$ to $M\cong \CC^{2^2} = \CC^4$; they're spinor fields. Raising and lowering operators form independent algebras on each momentum mode. $SO(1,3)$ acts globally on $\CC^4$ and the spinor representation instructs the spinor fields how to rotate with the global rotation. I don't actually see the picture...

# Deep Connection: $\Cl(V)$ is a *filtration-preserving* deformation of $\bigwedge(V)$

The natural [[filtered algebra|filtration]] generated by $V\in F_1$ induces a surjective map $\phi: \bigwedge V\to \gr\Cl(V)$ (in particular, $\phi: \bigwedge^k V\hookrightarrow \Cl_k(V)$). By dimensions, $\phi$ is an isomorphism of vector spaces. Here's the really deep part: $\bigwedge V$ and $\Cl(V)$ as isomorphic as $\so(V)$ lie algebra representations!

>[!idea]- Thought Process
> Multiplication by $a\wedge b$ sends $\Cl_{k}\to \Cl_{(k+2)}$, thus naively, the adjoint action of $\so(V)$ does the same. However, we have already computed three cases in which it does not: $\so(V)$ sends scalars to scalars, vectors to vectors, and $\so(V)$ preserves $\so(V)$ (bivectors).

The action of $\so(V)$ literally just rotates the basis. That's not going to change your degree! This also shows that the mapping $\bigwedge V\to \gr\Cl(V)$ has the power of picking the correct representatives for your $\Cl_{k}(V) / \Cl_{k-1}(V)$.

>[!idea]- There are a ton of ways to see this:
> - I mean, conjugation by $a\wedge b$ already preserves $V$. Thus $[a\wedge b, x_1x_2\dots] = [a\wedge b, x_1]x_2\dots + \dots$. This can *also* be realized explicitly, by porting the $\bigwedge V$-argument via symmetrization. 
> - We know that parity is conserved, thus if your degree does not increase by $2$, then it does not increase at all. Conjugation by $a\wedge b$ inside of $\bigwedge V$ annihilates you, because $a\wedge b$ is degree 2! Thus the same is true in $\phi: \bigwedge^kV\hookrightarrow \Cl_k(V)$.
>   

Thus, the action of $\so(V)$ on $\Cl(V)$ has sub-representations on $\Cl_k(V)$. But $\so(V)$ is decomposable, thus $\so(V)\curvearrowright \Cl(V)$ as $\bigoplus_k \bigwedge^k V\equiv \bigwedge V$!

# Conclusion

Thus, $\xi^*M$ is a representation of $\so_{2n}$ on a space $\cong \CC^{2^n}$ via $\rho_{\xi^*M}(a) = \rho_M(\xi(a))$. This representation reduces into $(\xi^*M)_0\oplus (\xi^*M)_1$ consisting of the even and odd-degree parts, which are isomorphic to $S_+$ and $S_-$.  $\xi^*M_\pm$ are representations of $\so_{2n+1}$ on spaces $\cong \CC^{2^n}$, and they turn out to both be isomorphic to $S$.

> [!proof]- Compute the highest weight vectors then stare at dimensions.
> After all the setup, this isn't hard anymore. In $\so_{2n}$, we care about the vectors in the joint kernel of $\{b_ia_{i+1}\}$, which are all of the form $a_k\wedge\dots \wedge a_n$. But this is also supposed to be in the kernel of $b_{n-1}b_n$, so our options are $a_n$ and $1$. Observe $a_n$ is a $1$-eigenvector of all $b_ia_i$ except for $b_na_n$; this is a highest-weight vector with weight $\left(\frac12,\dots,\frac12,-\frac12\right)$. Meanwhile, $1$ is a highest-weight vector with weight $\left(\frac12,\dots,\frac12\right)$. But we know these irreps have dimension $2^{n-1} + 2^{n-1} = 2^n$, which is all of $\wedge\left(a_1,\dots, a_n\right)$, so we conclude.
> 
> In $\so_{2n+1}$, we care about vectors of the form $a_k\wedge\dots\wedge a_n$ again. This time, we want to be in the kernel of $zb_n$, which leaves us no options; $1$ is a highest-weight vector with weight $\left(\frac12,\dots, \frac12\right)$ in both $\xi^*M_+$ and $\xi^*M_-$. It has dimension $2^n$, which fills $\wedge(a_1,\dots, a_n)$, thus we conclude.
