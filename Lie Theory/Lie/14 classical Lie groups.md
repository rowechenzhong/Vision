Let $k\in (\RR, \CC)$. Here are some important Lie Groups which are subgroups of the general linear group $\GL_n(\KK)$:
1. $\GL_n(\KK)$ lol.
2. $O_{pq}(\KK)$ (the ==**pseudo-orthogonal group**==) preserves the form with signature $(p,q)$ (we don't take conjugates here).
	1. $O_n(\KK) = O_{n,0}(\KK)$ (the ==**orthogonal group**==) is the group of matrices preserving the quadratic form.
	2. $Sp_{2n}(\KK)$ (the ==**symplectic group**==) is the group of matrices preserving the nondegenerate skew-symmetric form in $2n$ variables (signature $+-+-\cdots$).
4. $U_{p,q}$ (the ==**pseudo-unitary group**==) preserves the inner form with signature $(p,q)$ (with conjugates). This has analogous subclasses.

$7$ more ==**special**== variants of the above are the subgroups with determinant $1$.
