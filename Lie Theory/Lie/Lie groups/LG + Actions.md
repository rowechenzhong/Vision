> [!definition] Action
> Let $X$ be a [[topological manifolds|manifold]], and $G$ be a [[Lie/Lie groups/Lie groups|Lie group]]. An ==**action**== of $G$ on $X$ is a left-action $a:G\times X\to X$ which is a regular map.

# Lie algebras and Actions

>[!definition] Lie algebra action
>An ==**action**== of $\fg$ on $X$ is a homomorphism of Lie algebras $\fg\to Vect(X)$.

In particular, see [[Vect(X)]] for how an action $a:G\times X\to X$ induces an action on the lie algebra $a_*: \fg\to Vect(X)$.
