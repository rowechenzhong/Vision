The **==center==** of a Lie algebra $L$ is the set of all elements that **==commute==** with every element in $L$. It is denoted $Z(L)$ and is $\ker \ad$. Thus, an

The **==derived algebra==**, denoted as $[L, L]$ or $L'$, is the subalgebra generated by all **==commutators==** $[x, y] = xy yx$ of elements $x, y$ in $L$.

A Lie algebra $L$ is considered **==simple==** if it has no non-trivial proper **==ideals==**, meaning it does not contain any non-trivial proper subalgebras that are ideals.

The **==normalizer==** $N_L(K)$ of a subalgebra $K$ in a Lie algebra $L$ is the set of all elements in $L$ that leave $K$ invariant under the **==adjoint action==**, i.e. $\{x\in L: [xK] \subset K\}$. Note $K\subset N_L(K)$.

Given a subset $S$ of a Lie algebra $L$, the **==centralizer==** $C_L(S)$ of $S$ is the set of all elements in $L$ that **==commute==** with every element in $S$.
