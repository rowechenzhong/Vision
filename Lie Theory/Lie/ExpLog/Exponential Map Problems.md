Consider the [[Various Adjoint maps|adjoint representation]] $G\to \GL(\fg)$; we wish to show that this is constant. The thing is, $\GL(\fg)$ is just a set of $n^2$ numbers, so $Ad$ is just $n^2$ holomorphic functions. [[Basic Manifold Exercises#^holomorphic-constant|Thus]] $\Ad$ must actually be constant, which of course means it is $1$ (because $\Ad(\exp(x))$ acting on $x\in \fg$ does nothing).

Okay, we have an abelian group which also happens to be a connected compact complex Lie group.
