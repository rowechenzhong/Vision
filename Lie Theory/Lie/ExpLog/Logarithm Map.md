$\exp:\fg\to G$ is a regular map which is a diffeomorphism from a neighborhood of $0\in \uu\subset \fg$ onto a neighborhood of $1\in U\subset G$ such that $\exp(0) = 1$ and $\exp'(0) = 1_\fg$.

Thus, it admits a diffeomorphic inverse, called the ==**logarithm**==, over $U$, onto $\uu$. This coincides with the [[Exponential and Logarithmic maps on Linear Maps|matrix definition]].

The logarithm map defines a canonical coordinate chart on $G$ near $1$; a choice of basis on $\fg$ yields a local coordinate system.

>[!idea] $\fg$ is the canonical chart for $G$.
>We will basically never have to say the word ``chart" again when discussing Lie groups! $\fg$ (and $g\fg$ in general, via the differential of left translation) *is* a chart at all points in $G$.
