The ==**Sign Characeter**== is the homomorphism from the Weyl group $\eps:W\to \ZZ/2$ via $(-1)^{\ell(w)}$.

>Equivalently, $w\to \det(w\vert_\hh)$.

For $A_{n-1}$, this is precisely the sign of a permutation in $S_n$. An element $f\in \CC[P]$ is ==**anti-invariant**== under $W$ if $w(f) \equiv f\circ w = (-1)^{\ell(w)} f$ for all $w\in W$. For example, the Weyl denominator is anti-invariant under $W$.
