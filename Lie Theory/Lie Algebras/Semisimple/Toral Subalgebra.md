>[!definition] Toral Subalgebra
>A subalgebra of $L$ consisting solely of semisimple elements.

Let $L$ be nonzero and semisimple now.

If $L$ is entirely nilpotent, then so is $L$, which would mean it was solvable which is clearly cap. So find some $x\in L$ with nonzero semisimple part $x_s$; the span of all semisimple parts of elements in $L$ is an example of a toral subalgebra.

>[!theorem]
>Toral subalgebras are abelian.

This is cracked, because now they are *simultaneouly diagonalizable*. In particular, the rest of $L$ is split up into the simultaneous eigenspaces, the so-called [[Root Space Decomposition]].
