$L$ is called ==**semi-simple**== iff:
- It has no solvable ideals.
- If [[radical|$\Rad L = 0$]].
- [[Semisimple means no abelian ideals|It has no abelian ideals]] (other than $0$).
- [[Semisimple Simple Decomposition|it decomposes into Simple ideals!!]] (this is insanely strong).

>After a while, I finally realized that philosophically, semisimple Lie algebras are completely cracked because $L\cong \ad L$ naturally.

Notably, simple $\implies$ semi-simple. For arbitrary $L$, $L / \Rad L$ is semi-simple.

Semisimple Lie algebras are just too good:
- [[ideals are transitive in semisimple lie algebras]].
- [[Weyls Theorem|their representations are completely reducible]].
-
