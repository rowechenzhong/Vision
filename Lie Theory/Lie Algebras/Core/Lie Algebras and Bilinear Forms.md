Given a symmetric bilinear form $\beta(x,y)$, the ==**radical**== is $S = \{x\in L: \beta(x,\bullet) = 0\}$. If the radical is $0$, then $\beta$ is ==**nondegenerate**==.

Such a bilinear form is called ==**associative**== if $\beta([x,y], z) = \beta(x, [yz])$.

A symmetric associative nondegenerate bilinear form is called a "sand".
