For some reason, JCF is important.
- We like to call diagonal matrices "semisimple" for some reason.
- $\ad$ preserves semisimplicity and nilpotency; thus in a subalgebra of $\gl(V)$, $\ad x = \ad x_s + \ad x_n$.
- If $L$  is just some random Lie algebra, not regarded as a subspace of $\gl(V)$ or anything, we can still try to assign assign each $x\in L$ an ==**abstract Jordan Decomposition**== $x = x_s + x_n$ such that $\ad x_s$ and $\ad a_n$ are semisimple and nilpotent in $\gl(L)$, and $[x_sx_n] =0$. **This may not exist!!!**
- $Der A$ is closed under semisimple and nilpotent parts.


# Semisimple Case

If $L\curvearrowright V$ is semisimple, then $L$ is closed under semisimple and nilpotent parts, and the abstract and usual Jordan decompositions in $L$ coincide.
