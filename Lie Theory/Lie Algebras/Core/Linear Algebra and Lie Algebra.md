Lie algebras have more structure than vector spaces, which can sometimes be annoying.

A Lie algebra $L$ is a ==**direct sum**== of ideals $I_1,\dots, I_t$ if it is a direct sum of subspaces. In particular, $[I_iI_j] \subset I_i\cap I_j = 0$ if $i\neq j$, so the Lie algebra works component-wise as expected. This is written $L = I_1 \oplus \dots \oplus I_t$.
