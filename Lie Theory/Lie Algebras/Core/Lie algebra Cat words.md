A ==**morphism of Lie Algebras**== is a linear map $T:L\to K$ preserving the Lie bracket. $T$ is a ==**monomorphism**== if it is injective, an ==**epimorphism**== if it is surjective, and an ==**isomorphism**== if it is both.

The assignment $L = T_1G$ is called $Lie(G)$, the ==**Lie algebra of $G$**==. This is a functor from the category of Lie groups to the category of Lie algebras.

- We say $x$ and $y$ ==**commute**== if $[x,y] = 0$.
- A Lie algebra is ==**abelian**== if $[L, L] = 0$.
- We call a vector subspace $K\subset L$ an ==**Lie subalgebra**== if $[K, K]\subset K$.
- We call $K$ a ==**[[Lie ideal]]**== if $[L, K]\subset K$.
- If $L$ does not admit any nontrivial ideals, and $[LL]\neq 0$, then it is ==**simple**==.

To this end, we notice that $\ker T$ is always an ideal, and for any ideal $I$, $L/I$ is a Lie algebra. The homomorphism theorems work.
