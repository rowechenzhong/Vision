>This is a really intuitive result if you remember the [[Clebsh-Gordan]] story from quantum mechanics (or just generally have a feel for how $L_\lambda$ looks). Its not strictly related, but it feels really natural.

Recall that a [[fundamental representation]] of $\fg$ is a finite-dimensional irreducible representation with a [[Dominant Weights|fundamental highest weight]] $\omega_i$.

If you take any dominant integral weight $\lambda = \sum_{i = 1}^r m_i \omega_i$, and consider the tensor product $T_\lambda = \bigotimes_i L_{\omega_i}^{m_i}$ of a bunch of fundamental representations, you'll notice that the highest weight in $T_\lambda$ is $v = \bigotimes_i v_{\omega_i}^{\otimes m_i}$ the tensor product of each individual highest-weight vector.

>[!idea] Reminder
>The action of $\fg$ on a product of representations $V\otimes W$ is via $g\otimes 1 + 1\otimes g$. It's the differential.

I will call such a subrep a ==**main diagonal**==.
