# Enumerating the Lie Algebras

When enumerating the operators over a vector space, we diagonalize and discuss eigenvalues.

When enumerating the lie algebras (which are just $(2,1)$ tensors!), we want to diagonalize somehow. The way is called a Cartan Subalgebra.

In addition to the WCF, the main scaffold to classify representations of complex simple Lie algebras are:
- [[Minuscule Weights]] (Inessential, can be read during/after $\GL_n(\CC)$)

# Representation Theory of $\GL_n(\CC)$
Young Tablueax, the things you saw at the end of QFT2, they're all here. We really got to learn this.

# Representation Theory of other Simple Lie Algebras

Todo: discuss $B_n, C_n, D_n$ representations.

- [[Clifford Algebra Construction]]

# Integration on Lie Groups

See latex notes on differential geometry for a review of differential forms et al. Remember the representation theory of finite groups, with the characters and stuff? Yeah, let's run it back.

# All about Real Forms

Up until now, we have worked solely over the field $\CC$. In order to say things about $\RR$, we follow the usual algebraic strategy. First, we'll discuss in full generality of Galois extensions of fields $L$ over $K$; then we'll specialize to real forms.

# Topology of Lie Groups and Homogenous Spaces

Uh oh :) Let's see if my [[Homology Theory]] self-studying is useful at all.
