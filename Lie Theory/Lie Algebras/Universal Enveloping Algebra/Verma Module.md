The ==**Verma Module**== is the "free-est" module generated by a single highest weight vector $v_\lambda$ with weight $\lambda \in \hh^*$; it is generated by $v_\lambda$ modulo the relations $hv_\lambda = \lambda(h)v_\lambda$ for all $h\in \hh$ and $e_iv_\lambda = 0$ for all $e_i\in \mathfrak{n}_+$.

A ==**highest weight module**== for $\fg$ with highest weight $\lambda$ is a quotient of $M_\lambda$. Any finite-dimensional representation is a highest-weight representation, because you can just find any maximal weight, then generate a sub-representation based on it.

For any $\lambda\in \hh^*$, not necessarily integral, one can find a largest proper submodule $J_\lambda\subset M_\lambda$ (which is simply the direct sum of all proper submodules), yielding $L_\lambda$, which is irreducible. $L_\lambda$ is finite-dimensional iff $\lambda$ is a dominant integral weight.

# Construction and Intuition

Given a lie algebra $\fg$, I can split it into the positive and negative weight spaces (with respect to some polarization), $\fg = \mathfrak{n}_- \oplus \hh\oplus \mathfrak{n}_+$. When I consider the [[Universal Enveloping Algebra]], by the PBW theorem I can always rearrange the terms to lie in the order $\mathfrak{n}_-, \hh, \mathfrak{n}_+$, thus I can write
$$U(\fg) = U(\mathfrak{n}_-)\otimes U(\hh) \otimes U(\mathfrak{n}_+).$$
We can write a one-dimensional algebra $\CC_\lambda$ on which $U(\hh)$ and $U(\mathfrak{n}_+)$ act as $h(\lambda)$ and $0$ respectively; then $$M_\lambda = U(\fg)\otimes_{U(\hh\oplus \mathfrak{n}_+)} \CC_\lambda$$ is what we desire. As a vector space, it is simply $U(\mathfrak{n}_-)v_\lambda$.
