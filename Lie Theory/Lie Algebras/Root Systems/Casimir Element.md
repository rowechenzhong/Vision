Let $L$ be semisimple and let $\phi:L\curvearrowright V$ be faithful (injective) with sand $\beta$. For any basis of $x_i$, write dual basis $y_i$ over $\beta$. Then, $c_\phi(\beta) = \sum_i \phi(x_i)\phi(y_i)\in \End V$ is an intertwiner.

On the other hand, $\beta(x,y) = \Tr(\phi(x)\phi(y))$ is a natural induced sand. In this case, we write $c_\phi = c_\phi(\beta)$, and call this the ==**Casimir Element of $\phi$**==. Its trace is $\dim L$. If $\phi$ is irreducible, Schur's Lemma implies $c_\phi$ is a scalar, $\dim L / \dim V$.

If $\phi: L\curvearrowright V$ is not faithful, let $\ker \phi$ have complement $L'$; we construct $c_\phi$ over $L'$, which evidently commutes with $\phi(L)$ because $\phi(L) = \phi(L')$. Lol.
