We're working in Euclidean space $E\cong \RR^n$ with a positive-definite inner product $(\alpha, \beta)$.

The reflection about plane orthogonal to $\alpha$ is called $\sigma_\alpha$;
$$
	\sigma_\alpha(\beta) = \beta - \frac{2(\beta, \alpha)}{(\alpha,\alpha)}\alpha
$$

A root system is ==**irreducible**== if it cannot be partitioned into the union of two proper mutually orthogonal subsets.
