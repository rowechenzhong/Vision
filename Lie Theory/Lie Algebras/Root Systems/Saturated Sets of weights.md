A finite $\Pi\subset \Lambda$ is ==**saturated**== if$$
	\forall \lambda \in \Pi, \alpha \in \Phi, 0\leq i \leq \braket{\lambda, \alpha}, \qquad \lambda - i\alpha \in \Pi.
$$This set is stable under $\mathcal{W}$. It is possible that such a set has ==**highest weight**== $\lambda\in \Lambda^+$ (greatest under $\prec$).

Given a weight $\lambda \in \Lambda^+$, $\Pi = \{\sigma\mu \in \Lambda^+: \mu \prec \lambda, \sigma \in \mathcal{W}\}$ is a saturated set with highest weight $\lambda$.
 - This set is finite.
 - This is the unique saturated set with highest weight $\lambda$.
 - This set consists of exactly the dominant weights lower than or equal to $\lambda$, along with their conjugates under $\mathcal{W}$.
