The space $F = \Hom(\bigotimes_{1\leq i\leq k} (V^{\otimes m_i}\otimes V^{*\otimes n_i})^{\otimes d_i}, \CC)$ consists of the polynomials in variables $\{T_i\in V^{\otimes m_i}\otimes V^{*\otimes n_i}\}$ with homogeneity degree $\{d_i\}$. It is a representation of $\GL(V)$. We are curious about the invariants $F^{\GL(V)}$, because they correspond to ==**basis-free polynomials**== in $\{T_i\}$. This is equivalent to the space$$\Hom_{\GL_V}(V^{\otimes M}, V^{\otimes N})$$where $M = \sum m_id_i$ and $N = \sum n_id_i$. Then, by [[Schur-Weyl Duality]], the above splits into $\bigoplus \End(\pi_\lambda)$, where the sum is over $\abs{\lambda} = N$ such that $\lambda$ fits in $V$. This embeds naturally into $\CC[S_N]$, and indeed, $F$ is spanned by the ==**convolutions**== $F_\Lambda$ for permutations $\Lambda$ over the indices. This is the old contraction business you know from physics. Note that $F_\Lambda$ aren't linearly independent because multiple permutations $\Lambda$ may correspond to the same graph $\Gamma$. If you only consider $F_\Gamma$ for distinct graphs, they still span the space. For $\dim V\to \infty$, these are all linearly independent because all $\lambda$ fit. We say that $F_\Gamma$ are ==**asymptotically free**==.

Thus, for instance, there are no universal polynomial identities for matrices of all sizes, which implies that the coefficients in the BCH formula are unique (because they have to work for all Lie groups).
