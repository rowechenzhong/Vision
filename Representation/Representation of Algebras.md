>[!definition]
>Given an algebra $A$ and a vector space $V$ over field $k$, a ==**representation**== of $A$ is an algebra homomorphism $A\to \Hom(V,V)$.

>[!example] Regular Representation
>In the case were $A \subset \Hom(V,V)$, it's not that deep.

>[!example] Representations of Groups
>For any field $k$ and group $G$, recall that $k[G]$ is the vector space generated by $g$ with multiplication given by $G$.
>
>This is what we mean by a representation of a group.

>[!example] Regular Representation of Groups
>So like, if you take $k[G]\equiv k^n$, it's not that deep either.
