These are Rowechen Zhong's personal notes on mathematics, following Feynman's advice on mastery by teaching. To begin, check out some [[homepage|homepages]].

They are meant to be viewed in Obsidian (https://publish.obsidian.md/vision), but they can also be viewed just as plain markdown. Links will not work, because they are Obsidian-specific.
